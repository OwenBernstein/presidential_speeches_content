Mitt Romney,6/2/2011,"Announcing Candidacy for President in Stratham, New Hampshire",Northeast,"Mitt Romney, Remarks Announcing Candidacy for President in Stratham, New Hampshire Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/290352","Thank you for coming. And I want to thank Doug and Stella Scamman for hosting us on their beautiful farm. You know, everyone here today can tell a different story. We have different backgrounds and we wake up in the morning and go to different jobs … or, look for different jobs. We go to different churches or maybe don't go to church so much. I bet some of you have families who go back 200 years or more in New Hampshire. And there must be some who just snuck in across the border, from Massachusetts. I hear the taxes are better over here. But here we are on a beautiful June day coming together to begin a process that we often, quite naturally, take for granted. But it is really one of the great achievements in the history of the world. For all of our country's wealth and influence, those are not the source of our greatness. The true strength of America is self-rule, and a government that answers to a free and independent people. We live in the most powerful nation that ever existed. And it all goes back to a few men and women who had the courage to stand - and even die - for their belief in liberty and equality. Because of their vision, the United States of America is not ruled by a monarchy or controlled by an aristocracy. Though sometimes folks in Washington might act otherwise, we don't have a House of Lords with inherited power. And as the Red Sox like to remind the New York Yankees, there are no dynasties in America. Who rules this great nation? You do. Every four years you decide who will give that State of the Union address, who will set the course of the country, who will be Commander in Chief. What's true right here in this New Hampshire farm has always been true in America. Though each of us is different, though each of us will choose to walk a different path in life, we are united by one great, overwhelming passion: We love America. We believe in America. Today we are united not only by our faith in America. We are united also by our concern for America. This country we love is in peril. And that, my friends, is why we are here today. A few years ago, Americans did something that was, actually, very much the sort of thing Americans like to do: We gave someone new a chance to lead; someone we hadn't known for very long, who didn't have much of a record but promised to lead us to a better place. At the time, we didn't know what sort of a President he would make. It was a moment of crisis for our economy, and when Barack Obama came to office, we wished him well and hoped for the best. Now, in the third year of his four-year term, we have more than promises and slogans to go by. Barack Obama has failed America. When he took office, the economy was in recession. He made it worse. And he made it last longer. Three years later, over 16 million Americans are out of work or have just quit looking. Millions more are underemployed. Three years later, unemployment is still above 8%, a figure he said his stimulus would keep from happening. Three years later, foreclosures are still at record levels. Three years later the prices of homes continue to fall. Three years later, our national debt has grown nearly as large as our entire economy. Families are buried under higher prices for food and higher prices for gasoline. It breaks my heart to see what's happening in this country. These failing hopes make up President Obama's own misery index. It's never been higher. And what's his answer? He says this: ""I'm just getting started."" No, Mr. President, you've had your chance. We, the people on this farm, and citizens across the country are the ones who are just getting started. I visited with a family, Kathy and Dave Tyler, who live in a suburb north of Las Vegas, Nevada. You probably know families just like them. They're in their early forties, a couple who had worked hard, sacrificed to buy a home in a good neighborhood, the sort of place they wanted their daughter Allie to grow up. But now that neighborhood is being crushed by this Obama economy. First their neighbors started losing their jobs...and then their homes. And all around them now are abandoned houses... and abandoned dreams. When the Tylers wake up in the morning and get Allie off to school and then go to work and do everything they can to make it to the end of the month and hold their lives together, it doesn't matter if they are Republican or Democrat, Independent or...Libertarian. They're just Americans. An American family. And across the richest, greatest country on earth, there are millions of American families like the Tylers. Folks who grew up believing that if they played by the rules, worked hard, that they would have the chance to build a good life, with steady work and always that possibility to work a little harder and get ahead. And in that America, you don't wonder if your children will have a better life. You know they will. You know it the same way we know that tomorrow morning the sun is going to come up in the East right over this field. That confidence in a better tomorrow defines us as Americans. When generations of immigrants looked up and saw the Statue of Liberty for the first time, they surely had many questions and doubts about the life before them, but one thing they knew without a doubt is that they were coming to a place where anything was possible—that in America, their children would have a better life. I believe in that America. I know you believe in that America. It is an America of freedom and opportunity. A nation where innovation and hard work propel the most powerful economy in the world. A land that is secured by the greatest military the world has ever seen, and by friends and allies across the globe. President Obama sees a different America and has taken us in a different direction. A few months into office, he travelled around the globe to apologize for America. At a time of historic change and great opportunity in the Arab world, he is hesitant and uncertain. He hesitated to speak out for the dissidents in Iran, but his Administration boasts that he is ""leading from behind"" in Libya. He speaks with firmness and clarity, however, when it comes to Israel. He seems firmly and clearly determined to undermine our longtime friend and ally. He's treating Israel the same way so many European countries have: with suspicion, distrust and an assumption that Israel is at fault. To his credit, the President ordered the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. In Afghanistan, the surge was right, announcing a withdrawal date was wrong. The Taliban may not have watches, but they do have calendars. Here at home, the President seems to take his inspiration not from the small towns and villages of New Hampshire but from the capitals of Europe. With the economy in crisis, his answer is to borrow money we can't afford and throw it at Washington bureaucrats and politicians. Just like Europe. Instead of encouraging entrepreneurs and employers, he raises their taxes, piles on record-breaking mounds of regulation and bureaucracy and gives more power to union bosses. Instead of recognizing the states rightful authority to solve problems, he seizes power from them and rams through a disastrous national health care plan. This President's first answer to every problem is to take power from you, your local government and your state so that so-called ""experts"" in Washington can make those choices for you. And with each of these decisions, we lose more of our freedom. You and I understand this. We look at our country, and we know in our hearts that things aren't right, and they're not getting better. President Obama's European answers are not the right solution to America's challenges. In the campaign to come, the American ideals of economic freedom and opportunity need a clear and unapologetic defense, and I intend to make it—because I have lived it. Twenty-seven years ago, I left a steady job to join with some friends to start a business. Like many of you, it had been a dream of mine to try and build a business from the ground up. We started in a small office a couple of hours from here and over the years, we were able to grow from ten employees to hundreds. My work led me to become deeply involved in helping other businesses, from innovative startups to large companies going through tough times. Sometimes I was successful and helped create jobs, other times I was not. I learned how America competes with companies in other countries, what works in the real world and what doesn't. I left my business in 1999 to help put the Salt Lake City Olympics back on track. And when the Games were over, I came home to Massachusetts and served as governor. I'd never held office before but I went at it like I ran businesses and the Olympics: ask tough questions and take on the toughest problems first, because they'll only get worse. When I took office, I faced a nearly $3 billion budget hole. My legislature was over 85% Democrat. The expectation was that we'd have to raise taxes but I refused. I ordered a review of all state spending, made tough choices and balanced the budget without raising taxes. That sent a message that business as usual was over. Over the next four years, we consolidated agencies, cut programs, sold state property and cut taxes nineteen times. The state was giving away over a billion dollars in free health care, much of it to people who could have paid something but were gaming the system. You won't be surprised that a lot of Democrats thought we should be giving away even more. I took it on and hammered out a solution that took a bad situation and made it better. Not perfect but it was a state solution for a state problem. At the end of four years, it took over 800 vetoes but we balanced every budget, restored a $2 billion dollar rainy day fund and kept our schools first among all 50 states. All of these experiences -- starting and running businesses for 25 years, turning around the Olympics, governing a state -- have helped shape who I am and how I lead. Of course, if I ran through a list of all my mistakes, Ann would find it hilarious, and we'd be here all night. But I've learned a lot. Turning around a crisis takes experienced leadership and bold action. For millions of Americans, the economy is in crisis today, and unless we change course, it will be in crisis for all of us tomorrow. Government under President Obama has grown to consume almost 40% of our economy. We are only inches away from ceasing to be a free market economy. I will cap federal spending at 20% or less of the GDP and finally, finally balance the budget. My generation will pass the torch to the next generation, not a bill. I will insist that Washington learns to respect the Constitution, including the 10th Amendment. We will return responsibility and authority to the states for dozens of government programs - and that begins with a complete repeal of Obamacare. From my first day in office my number one job will be to see that America once again is number one in job creation. You know, if you want to create jobs, it helps to have had a job. I will make business taxes competitive with other nations, modernize regulations and bureaucracy and finally promote America's trade interests. It's time for a president who cares more about America's workers than he does about America's union bosses. Over the last thirty years, I can't tell you how many times I've heard a situation is hopeless. But I've never been very good at listening to those people and I've always enjoyed proving them wrong. It's one of the lessons I learned from my Dad. My father never graduated from college. He apprenticed, as a lath and plaster carpenter, and he was darn good at it. He learned how to put a handful of nails in his mouth and spit them out, point forward. On their honeymoon, he and Mom drove across the country. Dad sold aluminum paint along the way, to pay for gas and hotels. There were a lot reasons my father could have given up or set his sights lower. But Dad always believed in America; and in that America, a lath and plaster man could work his way up to running a little car company called American Motors, and end up Governor of a state where he had once sold aluminum paint. For my Dad, America was the land of opportunity, where the circumstances of birth are no barrier to achieving one's dreams. Small business and entrepreneurs were encouraged, and respected, and a good worker could almost always find a good job. The spirit of enterprise, innovation, pioneering and can-do propelled our standard of living and economy past every other nation on earth. I refuse to believe that America is just another place on the map with a flag. We stand for freedom and opportunity and hope. These last two years have not been the best of times. But while we've lost a couple of years, we have not lost our way. The principles that made us a great nation and leader of the world have not lost their meaning. They never will. We know we can bring this country back. I'm Mitt Romney. I believe in America. And I'm running for President of the United States.  "
Mitt Romney,8/30/2011,"112th Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention in San Antonio, Texas",South,"Mitt Romney, Remarks at the 112th Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention in San Antonio, Texas Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/298944","It's a privilege to be addressing the veterans who defended our liberty in the past, and who defend the memory and dignity of every veteran today. I was born in 1947 — a quintessential baby boomer. I grew up in the shadow of World War II, and then came the wars in Korea and Vietnam. As a boy, I knew that it was American soldiers and sailors and Marines and airmen who had saved us from German Fascism, and who protected us from Soviet Communism. You were our heroes then, and you are today. You know better than most that the world is still infected with purveyors of hate and oppression. Some are jihadists, some are communists, and some are simply tyrants who clothe themselves in any convenient political manifesto. And so once again, American heroes are called upon to defend liberty. We rightly call our fathers and mothers the Greatest Generation, but every man and woman who has or now defends American liberty — from the beaches of Normandy, to the Mekong Delta, to the valleys of the Hindu Kush — shares in their heritage of greatness. Every veteran is the greatest of his generation. The quiet heroes who have fought for our country come from the most diverse backgrounds imaginable: from farmers and subway riders, Ph.D.'s and high school graduates, and from every ethnic background of the American melting pot. But they are united by far more than what divides them. They believe in America. I believe in America. We believe in freedom and opportunity. We believe in the inherent dignity of every human being. We have a deep and abiding faith in the goodness and the greatness of America. But today we are united not only by our faith in America. We are united also by our concern for America. 25 million Americans are out of work, or have stopped looking, or have only part time jobs but want full-time work. Home values have dropped more than they did during the Depression. National debt is almost as large as our entire economy, and we owe a huge chunk of it to China. Incredibly, unfunded government promises now total about $530,000 per American household. This cannot possibly stand as the legacy we will leave the next generation. And the peril of this mismanagement may even be more imminent. We stand near a threshold of profound economic misery. Four more years on the same political path could prove disastrous. I am a conservative businessman. I have spent most of my life outside of politics, dealing with real problems in the real economy. Career politicians got us into this mess and they simply don't know how to get us out! To win this fight for America's future, we will have to rise above politics. When members of Seal Team Six boarded their helicopters, they did so not as Republicans or Democrats or independents, they did so as Americans. And the final image that Osama bin Laden took with him straight to Hell was not a party symbol — not a Republican elephant or a Democratic donkey — but an American flag on the shoulder of one straight-shooting U.S. Navy Seal. I start with the fundamental conviction that America is the greatest nation in the history of the world and a force for good. And while we are not perfect, I will not apologize for America! Our president has taken a different approach. Have we ever had a president who was so eager to address the world with an apology on his lips and doubt in his heart? He seems truly confused not only about America's past but our future. So critical was President Obama of America before the United Nations that Fidel Castro complimented him for his ""courage"" and ""brave gesture."" And Venezuelan dictator and thug Hugo Chavez joined in on the praise. We can't lead the world by hoping our enemies will hate us less. Ronald Reagan rallied America with ""Peace Through Strength."" American strength is the only guarantee of liberty. American strength turned the Cuban missiles around. American strength caused the collapse of the Soviet Union. American strength yanked Saddam Hussein out of his spider hole. With freedom as our cause, strength is our only sure defense! Today, President Obama is on a different course. First, the White House proposed cutting military spending by $400 billion over the next twelve years. Then, President Obama agreed to a budget process that could entail cutting defense spending by $850 billion. The incoming Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has called a cut of that magnitude ""very high risk."" Defense Secretary Panetta has warned that it could have ""devastating effects on our national defense."" And that's coming from a guy who works for President Obama. This is the first time in my memory that massive defense cuts were proposed without any reference to the missions that would be foreclosed and the risks to which our country and its men and women in uniform would be exposed. Cuts of this magnitude can only be the product of one of two mistaken beliefs. On the one hand is wishful thinking that the world is becoming a safer place. The opposite is true. Consider simply the Jihadists, a near-nuclear Iran, a turbulent Middle East, an unstable Pakistan, a delusional North Korea, an assertive Russia, and an emerging global power called China. No, the world is not becoming safer. And so, on the other hand, that leaves us with the belief that America should become a lesser power. It flows from the conviction that if we are weak, tyrants will choose to be weak as well; that if we could just talk more, engage more, pass more U.N. resolutions, that peace will break out. That may be what they think in that Harvard faculty lounge, but it's not what they know on the battlefield! But American leadership is more than a budget fight. America must lead with clarity of intent, a commitment of purpose and unlimited resolve. Unfortunately, when we look around the world today, we see a muddled picture of American policy and power. In the Mideast, we are pressuring our closest ally Israel to make concessions while putting almost no pressure on the Palestinians. The administration was quick to criticize Israel but slow to confront Syria's strongman, Bashar al Assad, even though he facilitated arming Hezbollah, allowed terrorists to cross his border into Iraq to attack U.S. troops, and turned weapons on his own people. Instead of calling Mr. Assad a reformer, the administration should have labeled him a killer.  "
Mitt Romney,9/2/2011,"National Hispanic Assembly in Tampa, Florida",South,"Mitt Romney, Remarks to Republican National Hispanic Assembly in Tampa, Florida Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/298934","As a nation of immigrants, we've found common ground not in our heritage but in our hearts. When generations looked up and saw the Statue of Liberty for the first time, or a piece of sandy beach that was freedom, or stepped off a plane traveling from tyranny to hope, these new Americans surely had many questions and doubts about the life before them. But one thing they knew without a doubt is that they were coming to a place where anything was possible—that in America, their children, and their grandchildren, would have a better life. That confidence in a better tomorrow defines us as Americans. I believe in that America. I know you believe in that America. It is an America of freedom and opportunity. A nation where innovation and hard work propel the most powerful economy in the world. A land that is secured by the greatest military the world has ever seen. But today, we are united not only by our faith in America. We are united also by our concern for America. 25 million Americans are out of work, or have stopped looking, or have only part time jobs but want full-time work. Hispanics have been hit terribly hard, with an unemployment rate that is higher than the national one. Home values have dropped more than they did during the Depression and Florida has seen some of the worst of it. National debt is almost as large as our entire economy, and we owe a huge chunk of it to China. This is not the legacy we want to leave our children. And the peril of this mismanagement may even be more imminent. We stand near a threshold of profound economic misery. Four more years on the same misguided political path would be disastrous.

Ronald Reagan rallied America with ""Peace Through Strength."" American strength is the only guarantee of liberty. American strength turned the Cuban missiles around. American strength caused the collapse of the Soviet Union. American strength yanked Saddam Hussein out of his spider hole. With freedom as our cause, strength is our only sure defense! A strong America starts with a strong economy. From my first day in office my number one job will be to see that America once again is number one in job creation. On Tuesday, I will present a detailed plan to get America back to work and to grow our economy. It will be bold, sweeping and specific. But any plan is only as good as the person leading it. And you know, if we want to create jobs, it helps to have a President who has had a job! I will make business taxes competitive with other nations, eliminate burdensome regulations and bureaucracy, and support America's workers instead of its union bosses. I will promote the exploration of our own natural resources, which will create countless jobs. I will make sure that America's workforce is prepared for the modern economy. Government at all levels under President Obama has grown to consume almost 40% of our economy. We are only inches away from ceasing to be a free market economy. I will cut federal spending, cap it at 20% or less of the GDP and finally, finally balance our budget. We must pass a torch to the next generation, not a bill. I will insist that Washington learns to respect the Constitution, including the 10th Amendment. We will return responsibility and authority to the states for dozens of government programs — and that begins with a complete repeal of Obamacare. Finally, I will vigorously advance our trade interests around the world. That means ratifying pending agreements with allies like Colombia and Panama to create jobs right here in Florida and across America. Three years ago, Candidate Obama promised to address the problems of illegal immigration in America. He failed. The truth is, he didn't even try. I am a great proponent of legal immigration. Many of you are living proof of the unique strength of America that is constantly renewed by new Americans. The promise of America has brought some of the world's best and brightest to our shores. It's what brought Mel Martinez, the first Cuban-American U.S. Senator here. And it brought to America the parents of Marco Rubio, who is one of America's great leaders today. I also believe that we must address illegal immigration in a way that is civil but resolute. Our country must do a better job of securing its borders and as president, I will. That means completing construction of a high-tech fence, and investing in adequate manpower and resources. We must also get tough on employers who hire illegal immigrants. That means putting in place an employment verification system that is both reliable and secure. Finally, we must stop providing the incentives that promote illegal immigration. As governor, I vetoed legislation that would have provided in-state tuition rates to illegal immigrants and I strengthened the authority our state troopers had to enforce existing immigration laws. As president, I promise to lead on this critical issue. The people who came to America did not come for a handout. They came here for opportunity. The President and his party are about handouts and the redistribution of wealth. That is not what brought people to these shores. Our party is about freedom and opportunity. It's as simple as that. They believe in government, we believe in freedom and opportunity. That's one of the lessons I learned from my Dad. My father never graduated from college. He apprenticed, as a lath and plaster carpenter, and he was darn good at it. He learned how to put a handful of nails in his mouth and spit them out, point forward. On their honeymoon, he and Mom drove across the country. Dad sold aluminum paint along the way, to pay for gas and hotels.

Small business and entrepreneurs were encouraged, and respected, and a good worker could almost always find a good job. The spirit of enterprise, innovation, pioneering and can-do propelled our standard of living and economy past every other nation on earth. That spirit came from Main Street, not from Washington. I refuse to believe that America is just another place on the map with a flag. We stand for freedom, opportunity and hope. And yes, we believe in American exceptionalism. Under this President's weak leadership, we've lost a couple of years, but we have not lost our way. The principles that made us a great nation and leader of the world have not lost their meaning. They never will. We know we can bring this country back. Together, we can restore this great land we all love. Thank you. God Bless America.  "
Mitt Romney,10/7/2011,"The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina",South,"Mitt Romney, Remarks on U.S. Foreign Policy at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/298938","'s a great honor to be in South Carolina, where patriotism is a passion that tops even barbeque and football. And it's a great honor to be here at the Citadel. Every great university and college produces future engineers, doctors, lawyers and entrepreneurs. Here at the Citadel, you do all that but you have another specialty - you produce heroes. Over 1400 of your alumni have served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere fighting the war against terrorism. And sixteen have paid the ultimate price. Since 1842, every tyrant, petty thug or great power that threatened America learned that if you wanted to take on America, you were taking on the Citadel. That's a line of heroes that's never broken and never will be. This is a true citadel of American honor, values and courage. The other day I heard the President say that Americans had gone ""soft."" I guess he wasn't talking about how hard it is for millions of Americans who are trying to get a job or stretch a too small paycheck through the week. As each of you looks beyond this great institution, to the life before you, I know you face many difficult questions in a world fraught with uncertainty. America is in an economic crisis the likes of which we have never seen in our lifetime. Europe is struggling with the greatest economic crisis since the Cold War, one that calls into question the very definition of the European Union. Around the world we see tremendous upheaval and change. Our next President will face extraordinary challenges that could alter the destiny of America and, indeed, the future of freedom. Today, I want you to join me in looking forward. Forward beyond that next Recognition Day, beyond Ring Weekend to four years from today, October 7th, 2015. What kind of world will we be facing? Will Iran be a fully activated nuclear weapons state, threatening its neighbors, dominating the world's oil supply with a stranglehold on the Strait of Hormuz? In the hands of the ayatollahs, a nuclear Iran is nothing less than an existential threat to Israel. Iran's suicidal fanatics could blackmail the world. By 2015, will Israel be even more isolated by a hostile international community? Will those who seek Israel's destruction feel emboldened by American ambivalence? Will Israel have been forced to fight yet another war to protect its citizens and its right to exist? In Afghanistan, after the United States and NATO have withdrawn all forces, will the Taliban find a path back to power? After over a decade of American sacrifice in treasure and blood, will the country sink back into the medieval terrors of fundamentalist rule and the mullahs again open a sanctuary for terrorists? Next door, Pakistan awaits the uncertain future, armed with more than 100 nuclear weapons. The danger of a failed Pakistan is difficult to overestimate, fraught with nightmare scenarios: Will a nuclear weapon be in the hands of Islamic Jihadists? China has made it clear that it intends to be a military and economic superpower. Will her rulers lead their people to a new era of freedom and prosperity or will they go down a darker path, intimidating their neighbors, brushing aside an inferior American Navy in the Pacific, and building a global alliance of authoritarian states? Russia is at a historic crossroads. Vladimir Putin has called the breakup of the Soviet empire the great tragedy of the 20th Century. Will he try to reverse that tragedy and bludgeon the countries of the former Soviet Union into submission, and intimidate Europe with the levers of its energy resources? To our South, will the malign socialism of Hugo Chavez's Venezuela, in tight alliance with the malign socialism of Castro's Cuba, undermine the prospects of democracy in a region thirsting for freedom and stability and prosperity? Our border with Mexico remains an open sore. Will drug cartels dominate the regions adjoining the United States, with greater and greater violence spilling over into our country? Will we have failed to secure the border and to stem the tide of illegal immigrants? And will drug smugglers and terrorists increasingly make their way into our midst? This would be a troubling and threatening world for America. But it is not unrealistic. These are only some of the very real dangers that America faces, if we continue with the feckless policies of the past three years. But of course, it doesn't have to be this way. This isn't our destiny, it is a choice. We are a democracy. You decide. In this campaign for President, I will offer a very different vision of America's role in the world and of America's destiny. Our next President will face many difficult and complex foreign policy decisions. Few will be black and white. But I am here today to tell you that I am guided by one overwhelming conviction and passion: This century must be an American Century. In an American Century, America has the strongest economy and the strongest military in the world. In an American Century, America leads the free world and the free world leads the entire world. God did not create this country to be a nation of followers. America is not destined to be one of several equally balanced global powers. America must lead the world, or someone else will. Without American leadership, without clarity of American purpose and resolve, the world becomes a far more dangerous place, and liberty and prosperity would surely be among the first casualties. Let me make this very clear. As President of the United States, I will devote myself to an American Century. And I will never, ever apologize for America. Some may ask, ""Why America? Why should America be any different than scores of other countries around the globe?"" I believe we are an exceptional country with a unique destiny and role in the world. Not exceptional, as the President has derisively said, in the way that the British think Great Britain is exceptional or the Greeks think Greece is exceptional. In Barack Obama's profoundly mistaken view, there is nothing unique about the United States. But we are exceptional because we are a nation founded on a precious idea that was birthed in the American Revolution, and propounded by our greatest statesmen, in our fundamental documents. We are a people who threw off the yoke of tyranny and established a government, in Abraham Lincoln's words, ""of the people, by the people, and for the people."" We are a people who, in the language of our Declaration of Independence, hold certain truths to be self-evident: namely, that all men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. It is our belief in the universality of these unalienable rights that leads us to our exceptional role on the world stage, that of a great champion of human dignity and human freedom. I was born in 1947, a classic baby boomer. I grew up in a world formed by one dominant threat to America: the Soviet Union and Communism. The ""duck and cover"" drills we learned in school during the Cuban Missile Crisis resulted from a threat by a known, identifiable enemy, with clear borders and established leaders. We needed spy planes to find the hidden missiles in Cuba but we didn't need them to find Nikita Khrushchev. President Reagan could negotiate with Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev and sign treaties for which each side could be held accountable. And when we caught the Soviets cheating, we could bring the world's attention to their transgressions. Today, our world is far more chaotic. We still face grave threats, but they come not from one country, or one group, or one ideology. The world is unfortunately not so defined. What America and our allies are facing is a series of threatening forces, ones that overlap and reinforce each other. To defend America, and to secure a peaceful and prosperous world, we need to clearly understand these emerging threats, grasp their complexity, and formulate a strategy that deals with them before they explode into conflict. It is far too easy for a President to jump from crisis to crisis, dealing with one hot spot after another. But to do so is to be shaped by events rather than to shape events. To avoid this paralyzing seduction of action rather than progress, a President must have a broad vision of the world coupled with clarity of purpose. When I look around the world, I see a handful of major forces that vie with America and free nations, to shape the world in an image of their choosing. These are not exclusively military threats. Rather, they are determined, powerful forces that may threaten freedom, prosperity, and America's national interests. - First, Islamic fundamentalism with which we have been at war since Sept. 11, 2001. - Second, the struggle in the greater Middle East between those who yearn for freedom, and those who seek to crush it. - The dangerous and destabilizing ripple effects of failed and failing states, from which terrorists may find safe haven. - The anti-American visions of regimes in Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, and Cuba—two of which are seeking nuclear weapons. - And these forces include rising nations with hidden and emerging aspirations, like China, determined to be a world superpower, and a resurgent Russia, led by a man who believes the Soviet Union was great, not evil. There is no one approach to these challenges. There is no Wall that the next President can demand to be torn down. But there is one unifying thread that connects each of these possible threats: when America is strong, the world is safer. Ronald Reagan called it ""Peace through Strength"" and he was never more right than today. It is only American power—conceived in the broadest terms—that can provide the foundation of an international system that ensures the security and prosperity of the United States and our friends and allies around the world. American strength rises from a strong economy, a strong defense, and the enduring strength of our values. Unfortunately, under this President, all three of those elements have been weakened. As President, on Day One, I will focus on rebuilding America's economy. I will reverse President Obama's massive defense cuts. Time and again, we have seen that attempts to balance the budget by weakening our military only lead to a far higher price, not only in treasure, but in blood. My strategy of American strength is guided by a set of core principles. First, American foreign policy must be prosecuted with clarity and resolve. Our friends and allies must have no doubts about where we stand. And neither should our rivals. If the world knows we are resolute, our allies will be comforted and those who wish us harm will be far less tempted to test that resolve. Second, America must promote open markets, representative government, and respect for human rights. The path from authoritarianism to freedom and representative government is not always a straight line or an easy evolution, but history teaches us that nations that share our values, will be reliable partners and stand with us in pursuit of common security and shared prosperity. Third, the United States will apply the full spectrum of hard and soft power to influence events before they erupt into conflict. Resort to force is always the least desirable and costliest option. We must therefore employ all the tools of statecraft to shape the outcome of threatening situations before they demand military action. The United States should always retain military supremacy to deter would-be aggressors and to defend our allies and ourselves. If America is the undisputed leader of the world, it reduces our need to police a more chaotic world. Fourth, the United States will exercise leadership in multilateral organizations and alliances. American leadership lends credibility and breeds faith in the ultimate success of any action, and attracts full participation from other nations. American leadership will also focus multilateral institutions like the United Nations on achieving the substantive goals of democracy and human rights enshrined in their charters. Too often, these bodies prize the act of negotiating over the outcome to be reached. And shamefully, they can become forums for the tantrums of tyrants and the airing of the world's most ancient of prejudices: anti-Semitism. The United States must fight to return these bodies to their proper role. But know this: while America should work with other nations, we always reserve the right to act alone to protect our vital national interests. In my first 100 days in office, I will take a series of measures to put these principles into action, and place America—and the world—on safer footing. Among these actions will be to restore America's national defense. I will reverse the hollowing of our Navy and announce an initiative to increase the shipbuilding rate from 9 per year to 15. I will begin reversing Obama-era cuts to national missile defense and prioritize the full deployment of a multilayered national ballistic missile defense system. I will order the formulation of a national cybersecurity strategy, to deter and defend against the growing threats of militarized cyber-attacks, cyber-terrorism, and cyber-espionage. I will enhance our deterrent against the Iranian regime by ordering the regular presence of aircraft carrier task forces, one in the Eastern Mediterranean and one in the Persian Gulf region. I will begin discussions with Israel to increase the level of our military assistance and coordination. And I will again reiterate that Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon is unacceptable. I will begin organizing all of our diplomatic and assistance efforts in the greater Middle East under one official with the authority and accountability necessary to train all our soft power resources on ensuring that the Arab Spring does not fade into a long winter. I will launch a campaign to advance economic opportunity in Latin America, and contrast the benefits of democracy, free trade, and free enterprise against the material and moral bankruptcy of the Venezuelan and Cuban model. I will order a full review of our transition to the Afghan military to secure that nation's sovereignty from the tyranny of the Taliban. I will speak with our generals in the field, and receive the best recommendation of our military commanders. The force level necessary to secure our gains and complete our mission successfully is a decision I will make free from politics. And I will bolster and repair our alliances. Our friends should never fear that we will not stand by them in an hour of need. I will reaffirm as a vital national interest Israel's existence as a Jewish state. I will count as dear our Special Relationship with the United Kingdom. And I will begin talks with Mexico, to strengthen our cooperation on our shared problems of drugs and security. This is America's moment. We should embrace the challenge, not shrink from it, not crawl into an isolationist shell, not wave the white flag of surrender, nor give in to those who assert America's time has passed. That is utter nonsense. An eloquently justified surrender of world leadership is still surrender. I will not surrender America's role in the world. This is very simple: If you do not want America to be the strongest nation on Earth, I am not your President. You have that President today. The 21st century can and must be an American century. It began with terror, war, and economic calamity. It is our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom, peace, and prosperity. My hope is that our grandchildren will remember us in the same way that we remember the past generations of Americans who overcame adversity, the generations that fought in world wars, that came through the Great Depression, and that gained victory in the Cold War. Let future generations look back on us and say, they rose to the occasion, they embraced their duty, and they led our nation to safety and to greatness. The Greatest Generation is passing. But as their light fades, we must seize the torch they carried so gallantly at such sacrifice. It is an eternal torch of decency, freedom and hope. It is not America's torch alone. But it is America's duty — and honor — to hold it high enough that all the world can see its light. Believe in America. Thank you, and God Bless the United States of America.  "
Mitt Romney,10/8/2011,"Values Voter Summit in Wasington, D.C.",South,"Mitt Romney, Remarks at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C. Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/298941","""I've been coming to this event for six years, and this is the biggest crowd yet. For that I suppose we should acknowledge President Obama. He's the conservative movement's top recruiter. Turns out, he really is a great community organizer. Although, I don't think we were the community he had in mind. In almost every other way, President Obama has been a failure. He faced a recession and he made it worse. He announced a recovery summer; a year and a half later, we're still waiting. 25 million Americans out of work or out of hope. Chronic unemployment is worse than at any time in recorded history. Home values and retirement funds have been devastated. And all this didn't come cheap. In one term, he will have nearly amassed more debt than all our prior presidents combined. We needed stability and solvency … but we got Solyndra. President Obama likes to remind us of what he inherited, with one glaring exception: he forgets to mention that he also inherited a triple A bond rating. But now the American people are starting to do some downgrading of their own. Last November, and in special elections since then, Americans have rejected the President's agenda. Just after his inauguration, he told the Today Show that if he couldn't turn the economy around in three years, he would be looking at a one-term proposition. Well, we're here to collect! The President has just unveiled his latest jobs stimulus, and he's furious that we aren't enthusiastic. But Mr. President, we remember your last stimulus, the one you promised would hold unemployment below 8%. It ended up costing over a quarter of a million dollars for every job you said it saved or created. A quarter of a million dollars! And we remember your cash for clunkers program; that ended up costing $24,000 for every car. At the rate you're handing out government money, every American will end up having to pay your millionaire's tax! President Obama has proved that maxim from Ronald Reagan—it's not that liberals are ignorant, it's that what they know is wrong! You see, I think that to be able to create jobs, it helps to have had a job! I spent my career in the private sector. I've met a payroll, and signed the front, as well as the back, of a payroll check. I've actually saved jobs and created jobs. And I know what it takes to get America back to work. Let me tell you some of the highlights of what I will do. Beginning on day one of my presidency, I will take bold action to help grow our economy and create jobs. I will issue an executive order that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to grant a waiver from ""Obamacare"" to all 50 states. Obamacare is a wolf in wolf's clothing—it's expensive, intrusive and unconstitutional. And that is why I will fight to repeal it. I will put an end to the job-killing regulations imposed by the Obama administration. I will open production of energy across the country. I'll remove the barriers to developing our coal, oil, and natural gas resources. I welcome renewable energy. But as an old venture capitalist myself, I can tell you this—there will be no more Solyndras! I will promote free trade and open markets. And, for stealing our designs, patents and know-how, and for manipulating their currency to unfairly attack our industries and our jobs, I will finally clamp down on China. I will protect the right of American workers to vote by secret ballot. And I will fight to stop union bosses from using the dues of their union members to support those bosses' favorite campaigns. Those steps are just a start. The plan I have proposed, which you can download for free onto your Amazon Kindle or at my website, has 59 action steps. These actions will do something that is critically needed: they will make America once again the best place in the world for business, for investment, and for jobs. Last week, the CEO of Coca-Cola said that the business environment in China is better than that here in the United States. China! If that is not an indictment of the Obama administration and of Washington, what is? It's time to let a conservative businessman take the reins of government to make sure that America, not China, is the economic powerhouse of the world! There is a growing chorus in the country of people who believe America's day has passed. They believe that we must accommodate ourselves to a world of multiple balanced powers. But God did not create this country to be a nation of followers. America must lead the world, or someone else will. I am guided by one overwhelming conviction and passion: this century must be an American Century. In an American Century, America has the strongest economy and the strongest military in the world. In an American Century, America leads the free world and the free world leads the entire world. Let me make this perfectly clear. As President of the United States, I will devote myself to an American Century. And I will never, ever, apologize for America. American strength rises from a strong economy, from a strong defense, and from the enduring strength of our values. Unfortunately, under this President, all three of those elements have been weakened. I have already spoken of the actions I will take to strengthen our economy. To strengthen our military, I will reverse the President's cuts to the defense budget. Time and again, we have seen that attempts to balance the budget by weakening our military only lead to a far higher price, not only in treasure, but in blood. I will modernize our Navy and Air Force, add active duty soldiers, restore a robust missile defense system, and give our veterans the world-class care they deserve. And I will repair our alliances. Our friends should never fear that we will not stand by them in an hour of need. I will reaffirm as a vital national interest Israel's existence as a Jewish state. I will count as dear our special relationship with the United Kingdom. And I will begin talks with Mexico to strengthen our cooperation on our shared problems of drugs and security. This is America's moment. I will not surrender America's role in the world. This is very simple: if you do not want America to be the strongest nation on earth, I am not your president. You have that President today. The foundation needed for a strong economy and a strong military is a people of strong values. The values I learned in my home have enriched my life immeasurably. I had a mother and a father at home. What a blessing that was. My parent's example led me to marry, to have children, and now to bask in the joy of 16 grandchildren. For the last 42 years, Ann has been my partner and joy. And what she has done has brought more happiness and meaning to our lives than what I have done, for Ann took the lead in raising our sons. Steve Jobs was asked whether he was glad that he had children. He said, ""it's 10,000 times better than anything I have ever done."" But marriage is more than a personally rewarding social custom. It is also critical for the well-being of a civilization. That is why it's so important to preserve traditional marriage — the joining together of one man and one woman. And that's why I will appoint an Attorney General who will defend the bipartisan law passed by Congress and signed by Bill Clinton — the Defense of Marriage Act. Unfortunately, when it comes to marriage, our government's policies are often out of step with our values. If a couple has a baby, the government will actually give them more support—in the form of food stamps, welfare, or other benefits—if they do not marry than if they do. Our safety-net programs penalize the decision to marry, instead of rewarding it. That's just wrong. And that's why I will eliminate these marriage penalties. And I will hold fathers financially responsible for their child, whether or not they have married the mother. Our values must also encompass the life of an unborn child. There are, of course, strong convictions on both sides of the life issue. Yet, it speaks well of our country that almost all Americans recognize that abortion is a problem. The law may call it a right, but no one ever called it a good. And in the quiet of conscience, people of both political parties know that more than a million abortions a year cannot be squared with the good heart of America. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. As president, I will end federal funding for abortion advocates like Planned Parenthood. I will protect a health care worker's right to follow their conscience in their work. And I will nominate judges who know the difference between personal opinion and the law. It is long past time for the Supreme Court to return the issue of abortion back to the states, by overturning Roe v. Wade. Because the good heart of America knows no boundaries, a commitment to protecting life should not stop at the water's edge. Taking innocent life is always wrong and always tragic, wherever it happens. The compassionate instincts of this country should not be silent in the face of injustices like China's One-Child Policy. And if I am president, you will never hear me or my vice president tell the Chinese government that we ""understand"" and won't ""second guess"" compulsory sterilization and forced abortion. Almost all Americans live for a purpose greater than ourselves. Our heritage of religious faith and tolerance has importantly shaped who we have become as a people. We must continue to welcome faith into the public square and allow it to flourish. Our government should respect religious values, not silence them. We will always pledge our allegiance to a nation under God. Our values ennoble the citizen, and strengthen the nation. We should remember that decency and civility are values too. One of the speakers who will follow me today, has crossed that line. Poisonous language does not advance our cause. It has never softened a single heart nor changed a single mind. The blessings of faith carry the responsibility of civil and respectful debate. The task before us is to focus on the conservative beliefs and the values that unite us — let no agenda, narrow our vision or drive us apart. The 21st century must be an American century. It began with terror, war, and economic calamity. It is our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom, peace, and prosperity. My hope is that our grandchildren will remember us in the same way that we remember the last generations of Americans who overcame adversity, that fought in world wars, that came through the Great Depression, and that gained victory in the Cold War. Let future generations look back on us and say they rose to the occasion, they embraced their duty, and they led our nation to safety and strength. The greatest generation is passing. But as their light fades, we must seize that torch they carried so gallantly at such great sacrifice. It is an eternal torch of decency, freedom and hope. It is not America's torch alone. But it is America's duty--and honor--to hold it high enough that all the world can see its light. Believe in America. Thank you. God Bless You, and God Bless the United States of America.""  "
Mitt Romney,11/4/2011,"Americans for Prosperity Conference in Washington, D.C.",South,"Mitt Romney, Remarks at the Americans for Prosperity Conference in Washington, D.C. Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/316069","As I'm sure you've noticed, the President has been traveling the country trying to get support for his new half-a-trillion-dollar stimulus bill. He keeps telling people, ""We can't wait."" To which I say, ""Yes, we can."" Upon taking office, this administration's motto was ""You never want a serious crisis to go to waste."" Since then, it's become clear that they don't know how to end one. The unemployment rate has been over 8% for 33 months. Our country has been running a deficit for 36 months. And just last week, nearly 400,000 Americans filed new jobless claims. We know that's not the best America can do. That's just the best this administration can do. We will do a lot better. Over the last 33 months, President Obama has offered a number of plans for getting the economy going. The problem is that most of his proposals are based on one idea: More spending and borrowing. Today, government borrows 36 cents of every dollar it spends. If we stay on the present course, we will face tomorrow what Greece, Italy, and Spain face today. But there is no nation big enough to bail us out. It took 43 presidents over 200 years to accumulate $6.3 trillion of national debt. President Obama is on track to borrow and spend nearly that much in just one term. His fundamental error is that he believes government creates jobs and opportunity. He's wrong. He puts his faith in government. I put my faith in people. That is why I will make government simpler, smaller, and smarter. This is not only good for the economy, it is a moral imperative. We cannot with moral conscience borrow trillions of dollars that can only be repaid by our children. We cannot so weaken our economic foundation that we jeopardize our ability to preserve freedom. There are some who argue that fiscal responsibility is heartless and immoral. No, what is heartless is to imperil our children. And what is immoral is to imperil the strength of the nation that was founded ""under God"" and preserved by His hand. This is a pivotal moment in the history of the country. We will either be led by men and women who care only for the present, who promise more and ask for less, and who ignore the tightening noose of debt–or we will be led by those who believe that deficits matter and who have the courage to act with fiscal responsibility. When I became the Governor of Massachusetts in 2003, the state budget was out of control. My legislature was 85% Democrat. Some thought we should just raise taxes or borrow more money. I said no. Even with about the most Democratic legislature in the nation, we didn't just slow the growth of spending, we cut spending. And we turned a $3 billion budget shortfall into a $2 billion rainy day fund. I learned how to balance budgets in business. In the private sector, you have no choice—you either balance your budget or you go broke. And you spend every dollar like it's your own, because it is. Someone should have told that to Solyndra. The federal government gave them a $535 million loan guarantee to build a factory in Fremont, California. The footprint covered 5 football fields. They had robots that whistled Disney songs. I am not kidding. They had ""spa-like showers with liquid-crystal displays of the water temperature."" The company headquarters was called the ""Taj Mahal"" of office buildings. That's how government starts a company. Let me compare Solyndra with Staples, a company I helped get started. Our headquarters was located in the back of an empty food warehouse. We got some used office furniture – old Naugahyde chairs. You had to be an athlete to get out of them. Every penny we had went into selling the product and attracting new customers. That's a difference between the private sector and government–fiscal responsibility. I took my business experience and brought it to the Olympics. I came at a time when the Games were in crisis. We had a $370 million budget deficit, and some said the Games would fail. The first thing we did was change the culture. We started with small, but symbolic gestures. We stopped renting fancy conference rooms for board meetings and charged board members $1 for a can of Coke and $1 for a slice of pizza. We cut the budget for things like decorations, brochures, travel, and motivational speakers. We could get all the motivation we needed from the performance of our athletes. We wanted the entire organization to know that every penny mattered. I used the commonsense principles I had relied on so many times in the private sector to come up with $98 million in immediate budget cuts. When it was all said and done, our Olympics were among the most successful ever, and instead of a deficit, we produced $100 million dollars for an endowment fund. In business, in the Olympics, and in Massachusetts, I've learned how to eliminate deficits and to produce results. When I get to the White House, no one will need to teach me how to balance budgets. I've been doing that for 35 years. It is time to level with the American people about what it will take to cut spending and balance our budget, to set honest goals and present a credible plan to achieve them. This won't be easy. It requires tough choices. Many believe it can't be done. I believe it must be done. I believe in the American people. When the nation calls, Americans deliver. Over the last 33 months, President Obama has grown federal spending to 24% of the economy, 24% of the GDP. As president, I pledge to reduce spending to 20% of GDP by the end of my first term. I will cap it at that level. And further, I will put us on a path to a balanced budget and a constitutional amendment that requires the government to spend only what it earns. To reach the 20% goal, we'll need to find almost $500 billion in savings a year in 2016. Upon taking office, I will immediately cut discretionary spending and submit a budget that returns spending to pre-Obama levels. However, as I said at the Citadel, I will reverse President Obama's massive defense cuts. Any savings we will find in the defense budget we will re-direct to rebuild our navy and our air force, to add active duty soldiers and sailors, and to provide the care our veterans deserve. The world has not become a less dangerous place. We must preserve our commitment to a military that is so strong, no nation would ever think of testing it. My roadmap to a smaller, simpler government combines three separate approaches. First, eliminate and cut programs. That will start with the easiest cut of all: I will repeal Obamacare. This alone will save us $95 billion a year. It's bad law, bad policy, and when I'm president, the bad news of Obamacare will be over. There are many other federal programs that we must either dramatically scale back or cut out entirely. For each program, I will ask this question – ""is this program so critical, so essential, that we should borrow money from China to pay for it?"" I like Amtrak, but I'm not willing to borrow $1.6 billion a year to subsidize it. I like the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, but I refuse to borrow almost $1 billion a year from China to pay for them. And then there's foreign aid. Did you know that we give $27 million a year in foreign aid to China? I will stop sending money to any country that can take care of itself. And no foreign aid will go to countries that oppose American interests. We spend $300 million a year on groups like Planned Parenthood, which provide abortions or abortion-related services. It's long past time for that to be over. So first, we will eliminate or cut programs that are not absolutely essential. Second, we return numerous federal programs to the states. That's because innovation, cost management, and reduction of fraud and abuse can far exceed what Washington is able to achieve. Medicaid is a prime example. We need to turn Medicaid back to the states and allow them to craft the healthcare solutions that suit their citizens best. By limiting the growth of Medicaid funding to CPI plus one percent, we will save $100 billion a year. Today, nine federal agencies run 47 different federal worker retraining programs at a cost of $18 billion a year. Just imagine how much is spent on overhead. I will send those workforce training dollars back to the states, empowering them to retrain workers in ways that fit the needs of their respective economies. In the process, we can save billions of dollars. Finally, in addition to cutting programs and returning programs to states, there is a third approach to reining-in federal spending. It is to impose far greater productivity and efficiency on government itself, just like is regularly done in every successful business in the country. Let me give you an example of just how out of control government has become. Former Secretary of the Navy John Lehman reports that during the Second World War, we commissioned 1000 ships a year, and the Navy purchasing department that year, which they called the Bureau of Ships, had 1000 employees. By the time John was Secretary during the Reagan Administration, we commissioned 17 ships a year. And Navy purchasing had grown to 4,000 people. Today, we commission 9 ships a year. And purchasing? It's grown to 24,000 people. A business like that would be out of business. We must cut the size of the federal workforce. On President Obama's watch, we've added more than 140,000 federal workers. The American people are increasingly working to support the government. It should be the other way around. I will reduce the federal payroll by at least 10%, saving $3.5 billion a year. And we can save billions more by cutting extraneous federal contractors. It's not just the size of the federal workforce, it's also the cost. Since President Obama took office, the number of federal workers making $150,000 or more has doubled. I will limit the salaries and benefits of workers in the public sector to those for workers in the private sector. Public servants should not get a better deal than the taxpayers they work for. By linking government pay with private sector pay, we will save as much as $47 billion a year. There are still other ways to make the federal government work more efficiently and effectively. We will attack the rampant fraud that exists in numerous government programs by enacting far stiffer penalties for those who steal from taxpayers. Cutting improper payments in half can save more than $60 billion a year. And we can save nearly $11 billion a year by repealing a political giveaway that protects unions from competition and drives up the cost of government contracts: it's time to repeal Davis Bacon. We will also find savings by combining certain government agencies and departments. For example, it makes very little sense that trade policies and programs are administered by so many offices in so many departments. Today, trade matters are housed in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Department of Commerce, the International Trade Commission, the International Trade Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of the Treasury. And guess who gathers our trade data? None of the above; it's the Census Bureau. Too many chefs not only spoil the broth, they make it inedible and prohibitively expensive. In sum, I will make the federal government simpler, smaller, and smarter by eliminating programs, by sending programs back to the states, and by making government more productive. I will provide for the national defense, enforce our laws, preserve our safety net, and honor all our promises to our elderly. This is the right course for a moral nation. Deficits do in fact matter. They matter if we want to convince entrepreneurs to start businesses. They matter if we want employers to start hiring. They matter if America is to avoid the shoals of economic calamity. They matter if America is to remain the shining city on a hill. To those who say that deficits don't matter, to those who spend and borrow to win the praise of the short-sighted, we assert that you are in the wrong, and we are in the right. My dad used to say that ""the pursuit of the difficult makes men strong."" Our next president is going to face difficult choices. Among these will be the future of Social Security and Medicare. In their current form, these programs will go bankrupt. I know that, you know that, and even our friends in the other party know that. The difference is that I will be honest about strengthening and preserving them, and they won't. President Obama has failed to articulate a single serious idea to save Social Security. I believe we can save Social Security with a few commonsense reforms. First, there will be no change for retirees or those near retirement. No change. Second, for the next generation of retirees, we should slowly raise the retirement age. And, finally, for the next generation of retirees, we should slow the growth in benefits for those with higher incomes. While President Obama has been silent on Social Security, his agenda for Medicare is disastrous. He's the only president in modern history who has cut Medicare for seniors—do not forget, it was President Obama who cut $500 billion from Medicare, not to preserve it or sustain it, but to pay for his vaunted Obamacare. And he put the future of Medicare in the hands of 15 unelected bureaucrats. These bureaucrats have the power to enact further cuts to Medicare without congressional approval, even if those cuts overturn a law previously passed by Congress. President Obama's so-called Medicare reforms could lead to the rationing or denial of care for seniors on Medicare. Unlike President Obama, our next president must protect Medicare, improve the program, and keep it sustainable for generations to come. Several principles will guide my efforts. First, Medicare should not change for anyone in the program or soon to be in it. We should honor our commitments to our seniors. Second, as with Social Security, tax hikes are not the solution. We couldn't tax our way out of unfunded liabilities so large, even if we wanted to. Third, tomorrow's seniors should have the freedom to choose what their health coverage looks like. Younger Americans today, when they turn 65, should have a choice between traditional Medicare and other private healthcare plans that provide at least the same level of benefits. Competition will lower costs and increase the quality of healthcare for tomorrow's seniors. The federal government will help seniors pay for the option they choose, with a level of support that ensures all can obtain the coverage they need. Those with lower incomes will receive more generous assistance. Beneficiaries can keep the savings from less expensive options, or they can choose to pay more for a costlier plan. Finally, as with Social Security, the eligibility age should slowly increase to keep pace with increases in longevity. These ideas will give tomorrow's seniors the same kinds of choices that most Americans have in their healthcare today. The future of Medicare should be marked by competition, choice, and innovation—rather than bureaucracy, stagnation, and bankruptcy. Our path for the future of Social Security and Medicare is honesty and security, theirs is demagoguery and deception. The plan I propose to make government simpler, smaller, and smarter represents the biggest fundamental change to the federal government in modern history. It is a change we must make if the words ""full faith and credit of the United States"" are to mean anything at all. We're not the first people to come to this realization. And we won't be the first people to be criticized for believing that responsibility is a virtue. President Ronald Reagan shared our conviction. In his first inaugural address, he said: ""It is not my intention to do away with government. It is rather to make it work — work with us, not over us; stand by our side, not ride on our back. Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it."" The task before us now is to reaffirm our conviction in the beliefs and values that unite us … in the challenges and opportunities that face us … and in the victory that awaits us. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America.  "
Mitt Romney,12/20/2011,"Bedford, New Hampshire",Northeast,"Mitt Romney, Remarks in Bedford, New Hampshire Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/298291","Six months ago, I launched my campaign for the Presidency not far from here on a perfect New Hampshire summer day.  I spoke of an America in peril, under a President who had disappointed even his own supporters and was clearly failing. Since then, the unemployment rate has remained stubbornly high. More Americans have lost their homes and more Americans have slipped from the middle class into a world of poverty they never imagined.  Our soldiers return from war unable to find a decent job.  Over the last six months, I've travelled up and down New Hampshire and across America. I've listened to anxious voices in town meetings, visited with students who are frightened by the magnitude of their college loans but even more frightened by the lack of good jobs.  From break rooms to back offices to living rooms, I've heard stories of the The Great Obama Recession. Of families getting by on less, of long planned-for retirements replaced by two jobs at minimum wage. It's a long litany of dreams deferred and economic stress that quickly become family stress. I've heard stories that will break your heart.  But let me tell you what I rarely heard — hopelessness.  Even in these most difficult times, the worst economy since the Great Depression, I've found Americans refusing to believe that these troubled days are our destiny. Sometimes with pride, often with anger, I've heard time and again, a constant refrain: This is not the America we love! This is not the America we deserve! That this is not the America of yesterday and we will not allow it to become the America of tomorrow!  We are Americans. And we will not surrender our dreams to the failures of this President.  We are bigger than the misguided policies and weak leadership of one man. America is bigger than President Obama's failures!  This America of long unemployment lines and small dreams is not the America you and I love. It is not a Live Free or Die America. These troubled years are President Obama's legacy but they are not our future! This is an election not to replace a President but to save a vision of America. It's a choice between two destinies.  Four years ago, many Americans trusted candidate Barack Obama when he promised to bring Americans together. But now we've learned that President Obama's idea of bringing us together is not to lift us up but instead to use the invisible boot of government to bring us all down. I have a vision of a very different America, an America united not by our limits but by our ambitions, our hopes and our shared dreams. I am tired of a President who wakes up every day, looks out across America and is proud to announce, ""It could be worse.""  It could be worse? Is that what it means to be an American? It could be worse?  No. If I am President I will wake up every day and remind Americans that not only must we do better but also that we can do better!  I believe in America!  President Obama boasts that he will ""fundamentally transform"" America.  I want to restore America to our founding principles.  I believe that our founding principles are what made America the greatest nation in the world.    Among these core principles is what the founders called the ""pursuit of happiness."" We call it opportunity, or the freedom to choose our course in life.  That principle is the foundation of a society that is based on ability, not birthright.  In a merit-based society, people achieve their dreams through hard work, education, risk-taking, and even a little luck.  An opportunity society produces pioneers and inventors; it inspires its citizens to build and create. As these people exert effort and take risks, they employ and lift others and create prosperity.  Their success does not make others poorer, it makes others better off.  President Obama sees America differently.  He believes in an entitlement society. Once we thought ""entitlement"" meant that Americans were entitled to the privilege of trying to succeed in the greatest country in the world. Americans fought and died to earn and protect that entitlement. But today the new entitlement battle is over the size of the check you get from Washington. President Barack Obama has reversed John Kennedy's call for sacrifice. He would have Americans ask, ""what can the country do for you?"" Just a couple of weeks ago in Kansas, President Obama lectured us about Teddy Roosevelt's philosophy of government.  But he failed to mention the important difference between Teddy Roosevelt and Barack Obama.  Roosevelt believed that government should level the playing field to create equal opportunities.  President Obama believes that government should create equal outcomes.   In an entitlement society, everyone receives the same or similar rewards, regardless of education, effort, and willingness to take risk. That which is earned by some is redistributed to the others. And the only people who truly enjoy any real rewards are those who do the redistributing—the government. The truth is that everyone may get the same rewards, but virtually everyone will be worse off. President Obama's entitlement society would demand a massive growth of government. To preserve opportunity, we must shrink government not grow it.  Last month, I laid out specific solutions to the spending crisis we are facing, including Medicare reform.  I'm very pleased to see that Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan, who has been a champion of reform, has joined with Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon to push a similar Medicare reform package that I hope will save this critical program.  But this is more than a spending crisis we face. Even if we could afford the ever-expanding payments, an ""entitlement society"" is a fundamental corruption of the American spirit.  The battle we face today is more than a fight over our budget, it's a battle for America's soul.  We can't begin to answer the question of who should be our next President until we start asking ourselves, ""Who are we as Americans, and what kind of America do we want for our children?""  I know that my answers to those questions are very different than those of the current President of the United States. President Obama has spent the last 35 months building a government so large that feeding it will have to consume a greater and greater share of your paycheck. And does anybody in America believe they are better off today than four years ago? He pushed through Obamacare, an entitlement program we didn't want and can't afford. He's refused to advance a responsible plan to strengthen existing entitlements.  Instead of fostering competition and choice, he's cultivating government dependence. President Obama talks about a country where everyone plays by the same rules, but when it comes to his favorite friends, he makes sure the rules don't apply.  He's given his supporters waivers exempting them from the burden of Obamacare.  His NLRB bullies businesses when they don't bow to union demands.  In the energy industry, he's picked winners — who turned out to be real losers — like Solyndra.   That's how an entitlement society works — those in government control the resources and make the rules.  And while the rest of us stand still, they make sure that their friends get ahead. The result of President Obama's approach is a staggering list of failures. It took eighteen tax increases just to get Obamacare off the ground.  Our growing welfare state is slated to cost $10.3 trillion over the next 10 years, that's $72.000 a household.   I will take a different path.  I will repeal Obamacare.  On the first day as president, I will issue waivers from Obamacare to all 50 states. I will strengthen Medicare by empowering the next generation of seniors to choose the solutions that are right for them.  And I'll send Medicaid back to the states because they know how to serve their citizens best.    My administration will create an environment where the private sector can thrive and American businesses can reach their full potential.  I'll reduce federal regulation, open up new markets, and fully exploit our energy resources.   I'll cut taxes, cap spending and finally balance the budget.  This time next year, all the yard signs will have come down; Town Hall meetings will be about local budgets, not the defense department or Medicare.  It'll be safe to watch television again, at least for a little while. Americans will have chosen.  The path I lay out is not one paved with ever increasing government checks and cradle-to-grave assurances that government will always be the solution. If this election is a bidding war for who can promise more benefits, that's a battle I'm not going to join. This will be a campaign about the soul of America, about American greatness.  I'm confident that Americans won't settle for an excuse that ""it could be worse.""  I'm confident that Americans will refuse to be bought off by cheap promises that turn into never-ending debts for our children and grandchildren.  This is a time when we look beyond who we are today and ask who we will become. Not far from here, an idea called America was born. It came in a moment when a peaceful people realized they could not continue on the same path. Those farmers and merchants, aristocrats and blacksmiths, put aside their fears to take up arms against the greatest power in the world. There was not a single rational reason to believe they could succeed.  But they believed in God and they believed in themselves. They believed that the guiding force in their lives should not be fear, but rather a strong belief that life without freedom is slow death and an abiding conviction that they could build a better world.  That world is America.  Here in New Hampshire, in Iowa, South Carolina, Florida, Michigan — across America — we are at the beginning of a democratic process that those early patriots risked all to secure. This is the moment when we reject failure and commit to make the disappointments of the past few years only a detour, not a destiny. We believe America can do better. Because we believe in America. And tonight, I ask each of you to remember how special it is to be an American. I want you to remember what it was like to be hopeful and excited about the future, not to dread each new headline. When you spent more time looking for a house to buy than searching for a new job; when you spent more time thinking about a vacation with your family than how to make it to the next paycheck.   That America is still out there. An America when you weren't afraid to look at your retirement savings or the price at the pump.  An America when you never had to wake up to hear a President apologizing for America.  I say let's fight for that America. The America that brings out the best in each of us, that challenges us to be better and bigger than ourselves.  This election, let's fight for the America we love.  We believe in America.  Thank you.  God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America.

Mitt Romney,1/3/2012,"Des Moines Following the Iowa Caucuses, 2012",Midwest,"Mitt Romney, Remarks in Des Moines Following the Iowa Caucuses Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/299560","We don't know what the final vote tally is going to be, but congratulations to Rick Santorum. This has been a great victory for him and for his effort. He's worked very hard in Iowa. We -- we also feel it's been a great victory for us here.   Ron Paul as well. Ron Paul has had a great night. This is -- this has been terrific. I think it's great that here in the heartland of America that a campaign begins. All three of us will be campaigning very hard to make sure that we restore the heart and soul of the entire nation. And thank you, Iowa, for the great send-off you're giving to us and to the others in this campaign. Look, this is -- this is a campaign night where America wins. We're going to change the White House and get America back on track.   I'm -- I'm proud tonight to have been introduced by my sweetheart of -- well, I was going to say 42 years, but we've been married 42 years. We've been sweethearts for longer than that. And behind her, four of our five sons. One of our sons, Ben, is a resident at a hospital so he can't be here tonight, but this has been a family affair for us and in this room we feel like family with you. You guys have been extraordinary.   This -- for those that don't know, this -- this volunteer team has done extraordinary work. I mean, I hope you understand. When I ran four years ago, we had 52 members of our full-time staff. This campaign, we've had five. And you guys have done the work under the work of Dave Kochell and Sara Craig. They are just heroic. Thanks, you two, for the work you've done.   And -- and you were working -- again, I am working and we're all working together because of our passion for this country and our concern that it's being led by a president who may be a nice guy, but just is over his head. And you look at -- I mean, I look -- I look at his campaign. You know, four years ago tonight, he was giving a victory celebration speech here in Des Moines. And he'd been going across the state making all sorts of promises. The gap between his promises four years ago and his performance is as great as anything I've ever seen in my life. We face an extraordinary challenge in America. You know that. And that is, internationally, Iran is about to have nuclear weaponry just down the road here. And this president, what's he done in that regard? He said he'd have a policy of engagement. How's that worked out? All right, we -- we... Yeah, not terribly well. We -- we have no -- no sanctions of a severe nature, crippling sanctions put in place. The president was silent when dissident voices took to the streets in Iran. And of course, he hasn't prepared the military options that would -- would present credibly our ability to -- to take out the threat that would be presented by Iran. He's failed on that. And then how about with regards to the economy? He went out and borrowed $787 billion and his administration said they'd hold unemployment below 8 percent. Hasn't been below 8 percent since. You've got 25 million people today out of work or stopped looking for work or unable to get the kind of job that will allow them to meet their -- their needs. This is -- this is not just a statistic, by the way, these 25 million people; this -- this unemployment of 8.5 percent. These are real people whose lives have been impacted severely, people who -- who lose their jobs over a long period of time. They sometimes lost their marriages, lost their faith, become depressed. This is just a tragedy and didn't need to happen. Almost everything the president has done has made it harder for businesses to grow and to hire and to put people back to work. And then, of course, there's one more aspect of his track record that's been a failure. He was critical of President Bush for not balancing the budget; for having such large deficits. His deficits have been three times larger or more. He's on track by the end of his first term -- his only term, by the way...   He's on track -- he's on track to put almost as much public debt in place as all the prior presidents combined. This has been a failed presidency. And I'm absolutely convinced that if we want to get jobs again in this country, it's going to be helpful to have a person who's had a job in the private sector to create jobs in the private sector.   You know, he said three years ago that after being inaugurated, he was on the Today Show, and he said, ""Look, if I can't get this economy turned around in three years, I'll be looking at one-term proposition."" And we are here to collect, let me tell you.   I will go to work to get America back to work by making America once again the most attractive place in the world for jobs creators and innovators and investors and jobs -- the jobs will begin to flow like they have in the past. I'll keep our tax rates competitive; get regulators and regulations to see their job is to encourage enterprise; make sure we open up new markets for American goods; and finally take advantage of the energy resources we have here in oil and gas and coal and nuclear and renewables.   And I'll also do the work of finally getting ourselves to cut our federal spending and capping how much we spend and balancing our budget. I -- I think it's immoral for us to continue to spend our kids' future year after year, trillions of dollars passed onto the next generation, knowing we can't possibly pay it back. It's wrong, and under my administration it'll end.   And I -- and you've heard me say this before. I've been asked, ""How are you going to cut programs?"" And I'm going to look at all the programs we have in the federal government and I'm going to ask with regard to each one of them, ""Is that program so critical that it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?"" And on that basis, we're going to have a lot of programs we can get rid of, and number one on the list is Obamacare. That'll be gone.   But this election is bigger even than jobs and a strong economy. It's bigger than a budget that's balanced and deficits and debt that begins to be reduced. It's really an election about the soul of America. The question is, are we going to continue to hue to the vision of the founders. When they crafted this country and wrote the Declaration of Independence they said that the Creator had endowed us with certain inalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And that word -- that phrase, ""pursuit of happiness,"" deals with the opportunity associated with this great nation. We are an opportunity land. People came from all over the world seeking freedom electorally but also freedom personally, able to choose their own course in life, they came to America. And by virtue of their successes, their passion, their energy, their pioneering, they helped lift the entire nation. They didn't make us poorer by their being successful, they made us as a nation better off. The president has a different view. Instead of seeing a merit society, an opportunity society, I think he takes his inspiration from the social welfare states of Europe. He wants to make us an entitlement society where government takes from some to give to others. The only people who do well in that setting are the people in the government who do the taking from one to give to the others. The right course for America is to remain a merit society, an opportunity nation.   The right course for America economically, personally, morally is for America to restore the principles that made us the shining city on the hill, our conviction that freedom is a gift of God, our recognition that America as a merit society where people, based upon their education, their -- their hard work, their risk-taking, their dreams can lift themselves and lift people around them and lift our entire nation. That's what we need to restore in this country. I love this country. I love the hymns of America: ""America the Beautiful"", ""O beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain"" -- corn counts -- doesn't it? -- as an amber wave of grain. [laughter] Yes. Another favorite verse, ""O beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife, the more than self their country loved and mercy more than life."" Do we have any veterans in the room tonight? Please raise your hand to be recognized.   And one more verse let me just quote: ""O beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years."" The patriots, the founders of this country had a dream that was not just for their time, but was an enduring dream. It seized onto our time. I don't want to do as the president says, to fundamentally transform America into something we might not recognize. I want to restore the principles that made America the hope of the Earth. I love our freedoms. I love our Constitution. I love our land. I love our people. And I love the fact that this is a land of opportunity. Let us restore the greatness of America and keep this land the hope of the Earth. Thank you so much for all your help.   On to New Hampshire. On to New Hampshire. Let's get that job done. Come visit us there. We've got some work ahead. Thanks, guys.    "
Mitt Romney,1/10/2012,"Manchester Following the New Hampshire Primary, 2012",Northeast,"Mitt Romney, Remarks in Manchester Following the New Hampshire Primary Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/299966","Thank you, New Hampshire! Tonight, we made history! This state has always been a special place for our family. Ann and I made a home here and we've filled it with great memories of our children and grandchildren. And this Granite State moment is one we will always remember. Tonight, we celebrate. Tomorrow, we go back to work. We remember when Barack Obama came to New Hampshire four years ago. He promised to bring people together. He promised to change the broken system in Washington. He promised to improve our nation. Those were the days of lofty promises made by a hopeful candidate. Today, we are faced with the disappointing record of a failed President. The last three years have held a lot of change, but they haven't offered much hope. The middle class has been crushed. Nearly 24 million of our fellow Americans are still out of work, struggling to find work, or have just stopped looking. The median income has dropped 10% in four years. Soldiers returning from the front lines are waiting in unemployment lines. Our debt is too high and our opportunities too few. And this President wakes up every morning, looks out across America and is proud to announce, ""It could be worse."" It could be worse? Is that what it means to be an American? It could be worse? Of course not. What defines us as Americans is our unwavering conviction that we know it must be better. That conviction guides our campaign. It has rallied millions of Americans in every corner of this country to our cause. Over the last six months, I've listened to anxious voices in town meetings and visited with students and soldiers. In break rooms and living rooms, I've heard stories of families getting by on less, of carefully planned retirements now replaced by jobs at minimum wage. But even now, amidst the worst economy since the Great Depression, I've rarely heard a refrain of hopelessness. Americans know that our future is brighter and better than these troubled times. We still believe in the hope, the promise, and the dream of America. We still believe in that shining city on a hill. We know that the future of this country is better than 8 or 9% unemployment. It is better than $15 trillion in debt. It is better than the misguided policies and broken promises of the last three years – and the failed leadership of one man. The President has run out of ideas. Now, he's running out of excuses. And tonight, we are asking the good people of South Carolina to join the citizens of New Hampshire and make 2012 the year he runs out of time. President Obama wants to put free enterprise on trial. In the last few days, we have seen some desperate Republicans join forces with him. This is such a mistake for our Party and for our nation. This country already has a leader who divides us with the bitter politics of envy. We must offer an alternative vision. I stand ready to lead us down a different path, where we are lifted up by our desire to succeed, not dragged down by a resentment of success. In these difficult times, we cannot abandon the core values that define us as unique -- We are One Nation, Under God. Make no mistake, in this campaign, I will offer the American ideals of economic freedom a clear and unapologetic defense. Our campaign is about more than replacing a President; it is about saving the soul of America. This election is a choice between two very different destinies. President Obama wants to ""fundamentally transform"" America. We want to restore America to the founding principles that made this country great. He wants to turn America into a European-style entitlement society. We want to ensure that we remain a free and prosperous land of opportunity. This President takes his inspiration from the capitals of Europe; we look to the cities and small towns of America. This President puts his faith in government. We put our faith in the American people. He is making the federal government bigger, burdensome, and bloated. I will make it simpler, smaller, and smarter. He raised the national debt. I will cut, cap, and balance the budget. He enacted job-killing regulations; I'll eliminate them. He lost our AAA credit rating; I'll restore it. He passed Obamacare; I'll repeal it. When it comes to the economy, my highest priority as President will be worrying about your job, not saving my own. Internationally, President Obama has adopted an appeasement strategy. He believes America's role as leader in the world is a thing of the past. I believe a strong America must – and will – lead the future. He doesn't see the need for overwhelming American military superiority. I will insist on a military so powerful no one would think of challenging it. He chastises friends like Israel; I'll stand with our friends. He apologizes for America; I will never apologize for the greatest nation in the history of the Earth. Our plans protect freedom and opportunity, and our blueprint is the Constitution of the United States. The path I lay out is not one paved with ever increasing government checks and cradle-to-grave assurances that government will always be the solution. If this election is a bidding war for who can promise more benefits, then I'm not your President. You have that President today. But if you want to make this election about restoring American greatness, then I hope you will join us. If you believe the disappointments of the last few years are a detour, not our destiny, then I am asking for your vote. I'm asking each of you to remember how special it is to be an American. I want you to remember what it was like to be hopeful and excited about the future, not to dread each new headline. I want you to remember when you spent more time dreaming about where to send your kids to college than wondering how to make it to the next paycheck. I want you to remember when you weren't afraid to look at your retirement savings or the price at the pump. I want you to remember when our White House reflected the best of who we are, not the worst of what Europe has become. That America is still out there. We still believe in that America. We still believe in the America that is a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom. We believe in the America that challenges each of us to be better and bigger than ourselves. This election, let's fight for the America we love. We believe in America. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.  "

Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/300256","You should hear when we win, I tell you, it's really something. Now this race - this race is getting to be even more interesting. I just want to say to you guys thank you so very much for all your help over the last days and months and weeks going across this great state. I appreciate all the calls you made, all the people that you brought into the polls for us. This was an exciting day for us. And I just want to say thanks to all the people that have helped. Let's begin with your governor, Governor Nikki Haley has been fabulous and I owe her so very much for her help. And treasure Curtis Loftus, who has chaired my campaign, I appreciate his help. There have been a number of state legislators, Nate Valentine has been one of those who has been with me from the very beginning, David Rad and of course the people of South Carolina, who helped this campaign, I owe you so very much. Thank you for this great night tonight. Tonight I want to congratulate, of course, Speaker Gingrich and my fellow Republicans at a hard-fought campaign here in South Carolina. We're now three contests into a long primary season. This is a hard fight because there's so much worth fighting for. We've - we've still got a long way to go and a lot of work to do and tomorrow we're going to move on to Florida. It's a state what has suffered terribly under the failed policies of President Obama. Now three years ago we had nothing but promises and slogans by which to judge this president. Today we have a record of deficits, decline and debt. President Obama likes to remind us that elections have consequences. Well, today the consequences are clear and the stakes have never been higher. I've said this before and I firmly believe that this election is a battle for the soul of America. It's --   -- it's a choice -- it's a choice between two very different destinies for America. President Obama wants to fundamentally transform our country. We want to restore to America the founding principles that made this country great and the hope of the earth.   He is -- he is making the federal government bigger and bloated. I want to make the federal government simpler, smaller and smarter and will do it.   He has raised the national debt time and time again to astronomical levels. I will cut the budget. I will cap the budget and I will finally balance the United States budget.   He has -- he has -- he has enacted job-killing regulations. I will eliminate them. He passed ObamaCare. I will repeal it.   The president -- the president has adopted an appeasement strategy. He believes that America's role as leader of the world is a thing of the past. I believe in a strong America and I believe that America must lead this nation, must lead this world and be the leader of the free world and the free world must lead the entire world.   In recent weeks, the choice within our party has also come into stark focus. President Obama has no experience running a business and no experience running a state. Our party can't be led to victory by someone who also has never run a business and never run a state.   Our president has divided the nation, engaged in class warfare and attacked the free enterprise system that has made America the economic envy of the world. We cannot defeat that president with a candidate who has joined in that very assault on free enterprise.   When my -- when my opponents attack success and free enterprise, they're not only attacking me, they're attacking every person who dreams of a better future, he's attacking you. I will support you. I will help you have a better future. I will make sure that America is a place of opportunity for all.   I'm passionate -- I'm passionate about our economic liberty because I have witnessed our free enterprise system as it rewards the hard work of many and creates prosperity for all in this great country. And over the past few weeks we have seen a frontal assault on free enterprise. We expected this from President Obama. We didn't anticipate some Republicans would join him. That's a mistake for our party and for our nation. Ours is the party of free enterprise and free markets and consumer choice.   The Republican Party doesn't demonize prosperity. We celebrate success in our party. That's a -- that's one of the big differences between our party and our president. He leads the party of big government. He believes in ever-expanding entitlement. He's wrong. We're right. And this is a battle we cannot lose.   Those who pick up the weapons of the left today will find them turned against us tomorrow. That's the choice our party gives America, or else we don't offer any choice at all and Americans in my view will demand a real choice in this campaign between those who believe in success and prosperity and opportunity, and those who believe in government. And I think they will choose us.   By the way, by the way, if President Obama think he can compare his record of job losses with my record of job creation, that a battle we're going to win. And --   -- and if he thinks he can compare his record of crony capitalism with my record of free market success, that's a battle we can win.   And let me be clear. If Republican leaders want to join this president in demonizing success and disparaging conservative values, then they're not going to be fit to be our nominee. Now, our campaign has fought very hard here in South Carolina, and in the coming weeks and months I'll keep fighting for every single vote. I will compete in every single state.   We're going to win this nomination and we're going to defeat President Obama in November.   Our campaign will be about the businesses I help start, not the bills I've tried to pass. And above all, our campaign will champion the founding principles of liberty, opportunity and economic freedom. I don't shrink from competition. I embrace it. I believe competition makes us all better. I know it's making our campaign stronger. And in the coming weeks, the ideals of free enterprise and economic freedom will need a very strong defense, and I intend to make it.   The American people -- the American people -- [laughter] Why, thank you. Ann agrees with you. [laughter] The American people will be looking for a real choice in this campaign, and I will provide it. The plan we're offering protects freedom and opportunity. And our blueprint? It's the Constitution of the United States of America.   If you want to make this election about restoring American greatness, then I hope you'll join us. If you believe the disappointments of the last few years are a detour, not a destiny, then I'm asking for your vote. We still believe in the America that's a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom. We believe in the America that challenges each of us to be better and bigger than ourselves. We still believe in that shining city on a hill. This election I'm asking for your support. We need to you join in the fight. Thank you and God bless the United States of America. You guys are the best. Thank you so much.    "
Mitt Romney,1/24/2012,"Tampa, Florida on President Obama's State of the Union Address",South,"Mitt Romney, Remarks in Tampa, Florida on President Obama's State of the Union Address Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/299820","Thank you.  It's good to be in the Sunshine State.  It breaks my heart to visit plants like this one. In 2008, this plant closed because of the economic downturn.  In a normal recovery under strong leadership, it could now be full of workers. Here in Florida, people used to wake up and look forward to a hard day's work and a good, honest wage.  The money they earned helped support families and build communities.  Today too many factory floors are silent, warehouses are deserted, corporate offices are empty, and real estate endeavors are abandoned.  Floridians are struggling to find a job, keep a home, and raise a family. As I've traveled across America, I've heard similar stories in virtually every corner of this country.  High unemployment and record home foreclosures.  Debt that's too high and opportunities that are too few.  This is the real state of our union.  But you won't hear stories like these in President Obama's address tonight.  The unemployed don't get invitations to sit with the First Lady. Instead, tonight, the President will do what he does best.  He will give a nice speech with a lot of memorable phrases.  But he won't give you the hard numbers. Like 9.9 — that's the unemployment rate in this state. Or 25 percent — that's the percentage of foreclosed homes in America that are right here in Florida. Or $15 trillion — that's the size of our national debt. Instead, tonight, President Obama will make the opening argument in his campaign against a ""Do Nothing Congress.""  But, we shouldn't forget that for two years, this President had a Congress that could do everything he wanted. With huge Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, President Obama was free to pursue any policy he pleased. Did he fix the economy? Did he tackle the housing crisis? Did he get Americans back to work? No. He spent $787 billion on a stimulus bill and put us on track to borrow and spend $5 trillion in just his first term. He forced through Obamacare — a trillion-dollar entitlement we don't want and can't afford. He took over auto companies and student loans. He stacked the National Labor Relations Board with union yes-men who, in turn, did favors for his campaign contributors and favorite friends. When we needed stability and solvency, he gave us Solyndra. When we needed a climate for private investment, he gave us Cash for Clunkers. When we needed more domestic energy to keep prices low and create jobs, he imposed bans on oil drilling and turned his EPA regulators loose to slow our development of natural gas. He's spearheaded one of the largest expansions of government in American history.  And he's paying for it with money borrowed from China. Three years ago, we measured Candidate Obama by his hopeful promises and slogans. Today, President Obama has amassed an actual record of debt, decline, and disappointment. This President's agenda made these troubled times last longer.  He and his allies made it harder for the economy to recover. Instead of solving the housing crisis and getting Americans back to work, President Obama has been building a European-style welfare state.  He has pushed for a second stimulus and deep cuts to our national defense.  He's asking the American people for another trillion dollars — and another term in office. He keeps telling people, ""We can't wait."" To which I say, ""Yes, we can."" Tonight, the President will deliver his State of the Union.  But make no mistake: What he's really offering are partisan planks for his re-election campaign. The President has been telling people that his agenda will create an economy that's ""built to last.""  Well, let's talk about what has lasted. What has lasted is unemployment above 8% for 35 straight months.  What will last is almost as much debt in four years as all the prior presidents combined.  What will last are home values that are too low and foreclosure rates that are too high.  And a legacy of debt that will imperil future generations. What is critical is that we make today Barack Obama's last State of the Union. The President's agenda sounds less like ""built to last"" and more like doomed to fail.  What he's proposing is more of the same: more taxes, more spending, and more regulation.  And all of his proposals involve ""big"" government and ""big"" price tags. Tonight, we'll also be treated to more divisive rhetoric from a desperate campaigner-in-chief.  It's shameful for a President to use the State of the Union to divide our nation.  And someone ought to tell him:  In order for the economy to truly ""work for everyone,"" everyone needs to be working. But more than anything, I expect the President will take this opportunity to take another victory lap.  In big speeches, he tends to tell tall tales about an America that's thriving on his watch. In 2010, he announced that ""the worst of this economic storm has passed.""  I know the people of Tampa don't believe that.  Today, 24 million Americans are struggling for work.  2.8 million Americans have lost their homes.  But President Obama believes he ranks among the four best presidents in history. Here in Florida, you know better.  You know that this President has run out of ideas.  He's run out of excuses.  And, with your help, 2012 will be the year he runs out of time. If tonight were the first message to Congress in a Romney administration, I'd have the courage to tell the American people how it is and tell Congress what we really need to do.  I wouldn't spend my time blaming others for how we got in this mess; I'd explain how we're going to get out of it.  I'd use the State of the Union to lay out an agenda that will get our country back on track and get our fiscal house in order. My agenda would make government simpler, smaller, and smarter. As President, I will repeal unnecessary regulations and restore our good credit rating. I will reduce tax rates and simplify the tax code, especially for middle-income Americans. I will streamline regulation, ensure the prompt review of projects, and order agencies to focus on economic growth.  The Keystone Pipeline is a real ""shovel-ready"" project that would put 20,000 Americans back to work.  Three years of review is long enough.  The President was wrong to reject it.  I will approve it. I will open up new markets for American goods, and open up our lands so that we can finally develop our energy resources.  A revolution in drilling for natural gas has opened up new supplies that will create American jobs, provide affordable energy, and offer our manufacturers a competitive edge.  My administration will support the development of these resources, not find excuses to stand in the way. If I were speaking to Congress tonight, I'd note that it's now been one thousand days since the Senate last passed a budget.  That's irresponsible.  It's unacceptable.  And, as President, I will cut spending, cap spending, and finally balance the budget. I would pledge to do all that a President can to get America working again.  When it comes to the economy, my highest priority would be worrying about your job, not saving my own. As President, I will reverse the Obama-era defense cuts.  I believe a strong America must — and will — lead the future.  I will insist on a military so powerful that no one would ever think of challenging it. That is the State of the Union I would deliver tonight.  My plans protect our freedom and preserve opportunity.  They reflect common-sense solutions and conservative values.  And, over the past seven months, that agenda has rallied millions of Americans to our cause. Our campaign is about more than replacing a President; it is about saving the soul of America. This election is a choice between two very different destinies. President Obama wants to ""fundamentally transform"" America. We want to restore America to the founding principles that made this country great. This President puts his faith in government. We put our faith in the American people. Ours is the party of free enterprise, free markets, and consumer choice.  The Republican Party stands for personal responsibility and equal opportunity.  We don't demonize prosperity.  We celebrate success. That's the difference between our party and this President.  He leads the party of big government.  He believes in ever-expanding entitlement. He's wrong.  We're right.  And this is a battle we cannot lose. During my 25 years in business, I helped companies like Staples and the Sports Authority grow from start-ups to international enterprises.  I turned around companies, a state government, and an Olympics.  And I am passionate about our economic liberty because I have seen it reward the hard work of many — and create prosperity for all. I have the experience to get America back to work.  I have the judgment we need in the White House.  And I will offer a real choice in the coming campaign. Tonight will mark another chapter in the misguided policies of the last three years — and the failed leadership of one man.  But Americans know that our future is brighter and better than these troubled times. We still believe in the hope, the promise, and the dream of America. We still believe in that shining city on a hill. A year from now a President will be giving another State of the Union address.  The choice before us is clear. Do we want a president who will try to explain again why his policies haven't worked? Do we want a president who will keep promising that this time he will get it right? Do we want a president who keep telling us why he's right and why we're wrong? Or do we want the sense of excitement that comes with a new beginning? We are Americans and Americans don't have to settle for a president who argues that things could be worse.  We know that things can — and must — be better. If you want to make this election about restoring American greatness, then I hope you will join us. If you believe the disappointments of the last few years are a detour, not our destiny, then I am asking for your support. If you share my belief that we need to scale back government so that we can expand prosperity, then I need your vote. Thank you.  And God bless the United States of America.  "
Mitt Romney,1/31/2012,"Tampa, Florida Following the Florida Primary",South,"Mitt Romney, Remarks in Tampa Following the Florida Primary Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/299232","Thank you all. To the people of Florida tonight, thank you for this great victory. There are fewer candidates than when the race began, but the three gentlemen left are serious and able competitors. And I congratulate them on another hard-fought contest in this campaign. Primary contests are not easy — and they're not supposed to be. As this primary unfolds, our opponents in the other party have been watching. They like to comfort themselves with the thought that a competitive campaign will leave us divided and weak. But I've got some news for them: A competitive primary does not divide us; it prepares us. And when we gather here in Tampa seven months from now for our convention, ours will be a united party with a winning ticket for America! Three years ago this week, a newly elected President Obama faced the American people and said that if he couldn't turn the economy around in three years, he'd be looking at a one-term proposition. We're here to collect. Since then, we've had 35 months of unemployment over 8 percent. Under this President, Americans have seen more job losses and more home foreclosures than under any President in modern history. In the last ten days, I met a father who was terrified that this would be the last night his family would sleep in the only home his son has ever known. I've met seniors who thought these would be their best years and now live day to day worried about making ends meet. I've met Hispanic entrepreneurs who thought they had achieved the American Dream and are now seeing it disappear. In his State of the Union Address, the President actually said, ""Let's remember how we got here."" Don't worry, Mr. President, we remember exactly how we got here! You won the election! Leadership is about taking responsibility, not making excuses. In another era of American crisis, Thomas Paine is reported to have said, ""Lead, follow, or get out of the way."" Mr. President, you were elected to lead, you chose to follow, and now it's time for you to get out of the way! I stand ready to lead this Party and our nation. As a man who has spent his life outside Washington, I know what it is like to start a business. I know how extraordinarily difficult it is to build something from nothing. I know how government kills jobs and, yes, how it can help. My leadership helped build businesses from scratch. My leadership helped save the Olympics from scandal and give our athletes the chance to make us all proud. My leadership cut taxes 19 times and cast over 800 vetoes. We balanced every budget, and we kept our schools first among fifty states. My leadership will end the Obama era and begin a new era of American prosperity! This campaign is about more than replacing a President. It is about saving the soul of America. President Obama and I have two very different visions of America. President Obama wants to grow government and continue to amass trillion dollar deficits. I will not just slow the growth of government, I will cut it. I will not just freeze government's share of the total economy, I will reduce it. And, without raising taxes, I will finally balance the budget. President Obama's view of capitalism is to send your money to his friends' companies. My vision for free enterprise is to return entrepreneurship to the genius and creativity of the American people. On one of the most personal matters of our lives, our health care, President Obama would turn decision making over to government bureaucrats. He forced through Obamacare; I will repeal it. Like his colleagues in the faculty lounge who think they know better, President Obama demonizes and denigrates almost every sector of our economy. I will make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for innovators, and for job creators. And unlike the other people running for President, I know how to do that. President Obama orders religious organizations to violate their conscience; I will defend religious liberty and overturn regulations that trample on our first freedom. President Obama believes America's role as leader in the world is a thing of the past. He is intent on shrinking our military capacity at a time when the world faces rising threats. I will insist on a military so powerful no one would ever think of challenging it. President Obama has adopted a strategy of appeasement and apology. I will stand with our friends and speak out for those seeking freedom. President Obama wants to ""fundamentally transform"" America. We want to restore America to the founding principles that made this country great. Our plans protect freedom and opportunity, and our blueprint is the Constitution of the United States. Together, we will build an America where ""hope"" is a new job with a paycheck, not a faded word on an old bumper sticker. The path I lay out is not one paved with ever increasing government checks and cradle-to-grave assurances that government will always be the solution. If this election is a bidding war for who can promise more benefits, then I'm not your President. You have that President today.? But if you want to make this election about restoring American greatness, then I hope you will join us. If you believe the disappointments of the last few years are a detour, not our destiny, then I am asking for your vote. I'm asking each of you to remember how special it is to be an American. I want you to remember what it was like to be hopeful and excited about the future, not to dread each new headline. I want you to remember when you spent more time dreaming about where to send your kids to college than wondering how to make it to the next paycheck. I want you to remember when you weren't afraid to look at your retirement savings or the price at the pump. I want you to remember when our White House reflected the best of who we are, not the worst of what Europe has become. That America is still out there. We still believe in that America. We still believe in the America that is a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom. We believe in the America that challenges each of us to be better and bigger than ourselves. This election, let's fight for the America we love. We believe in America. Thank you. And God bless America.    "
Mitt Romney,2/4/2012,Las Vegas Following the Nevada Caucuses,West,"Mitt Romney, Remarks in Las Vegas Following the Nevada Caucuses Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/300375","hank you. Thank you, guys. Wow, what a great showing. Thank you, Nevada. You know, this is not the first time you gave me your vote of confidence, and this time I'm going to take it to the White House. Four years ago, candidate Obama came to Nevada, promising to help. But after he was elected, his help was telling people to skip coming here for conventions and meetings. Today, Nevada unemployment is over 12 percent. Home values have plummeted. And Nevada's foreclosure rate is the highest in the nation. I've walked in Nevada neighborhoods blighted by abandoned homes, where people wonder why Barack Obama failed them. Well, Mr. President, Nevada has had enough of your kind of help.   Three years ago, a newly-elected President Obama told America that if Congress approved his plan to borrow nearly a trillion dollars, he would hold unemployment below 8 percent. It hasn't been below 8 percent since. This week he's been trying to take a bow for 8.3 percent unemployment. Not so fast, Mr. President. This is the 36th straight month with unemployment above the red line your own administration drew. And if you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent. Mr. President, America has also had enough of your kind of help.   : Let me ask you -- let me ask you here a question. Did Obama care encourage businesses to hire more people? Did Dodd Frank get banks to renegotiate and make more loans?: Did the National Labor Relations Board attack on Boeing in South Carolina encourage employers to expand here? efforts to block the domestic production of energy and the Keystone pipeline speed job creation: And did those billions of dollars the president sent to his green energy buddies give anyone here a job? Mr. President, we welcome any good news on the jobs front. But it is thanks to the innovation of the American people in the private sector and not to you, Mr. President This president's misguided policies made these tough times last longer. Earlier in the week, he spoke with a woman from Texas during an online event. She told him that her husband has been out of work for three years. President Obama said that he found that ""interesting."" Interesting? Really? I've got a better word. Tragic. America needs a president who can fix the economy because he understands the economy, and I do, and I will.   This president began his presidency by apologizing for America. He should now be apologizing to America. We're not going to settle - we're not going to settle for a president who tells us it could be worse. What defines us as Americans is our conviction that things must be better. That conviction guides this campaign. It's rallied millions of Americans to our cause, including tens of thousands of Nevadans, who gave me their support here today and I thank them.   Nevadans know that our future is brighter and better than these troubled times. It's better than 15 percent real unemployment. It's better than $15 trillion in debt. It's better than the misguided policies and broken promises of the last three years and the failed leadership of one man. Our campaign is about more than just replacing the president, however. This is really a campaign about saving the soul of America. President Obama says he wants to fundamentally transform America. We want to restore to America the founding principles that made this country great.   Our vision for the future could not be more different than his. President Obama will grow government and amass more trillion dollar deficits. I will not de-slow the growth of government, I will cut it. I will not just freeze -- I will not just freeze government share of the total economy, I will reduce it. And without raising taxes, I will finally balance the American budget.   President Obama's brand of capitalism sends your money to his friend's companies. My vision for free enterprise is to return entrepreneurship to the genius of consumer markets and to the creativity of the American people.   Now, like his colleagues in fat lounges, they think they know better. President Obama demonizes and denigrates almost every sector of our economy. I will instead make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for innovators and for job creators and get America working again!   And by the way, unlike the other people running for president, I know just how to do that.   If I'm elected president, my priority will be worrying about your job, not saving my own.   Now, as you know, one of the most important and personal matters of our lives is our health care. President Obama would turn the decision making over to government bureaucrats. He forced through Obama Care. I will repeal Obama Care.   The president -- just this week, President Obama orders religious organizations to violate their conscience. I will defend religious liberty and overturn any regulation that tramples on our first freedom, our right to worship as we choose. President Obama is shrinking our military and hollowing out our national defense. I will insist on a military so powerful that no one in the world would ever think of challenging us. President Obama seems to believe that America's role as leader in the world is a thing of the past. I believe the 21st century will be and must be an American century.   Our mission -- our mission is to increase the freedom and opportunity of the American people and our blueprint is the constitution of the United States. We're going to build an America where hope is a new job with a paycheck, not a faded word on an old bumper sticker.   And I will not attempt to bribe the voters with promises of new programs and new subsidies and ever increasing checks from government. If this election is a bidding war of who can promise the most benefits, then I'm not your president. You have that president today. But if you want to make this election about restoring American greatness, then I hope you'll join with us.   If you believe the disappointments of the last few years are a detour and not our destiny, then I'm asking for your vote. I'm asking each of you to remember how special it is to be an American. I want you to remember why it was you or your ancestors who sacrificed to come to America and to overcome the challenges of life in a new country, why they came here. It was not for a free ticket, it was for freedom.   It was not for the pursuit of government benefits, it was for the pursuit of happiness. We still believe in that America. We still believe in the America that is a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom. We believe in the America that challenges each of us to be bigger and better than ourselves. This election, we must fight for the America we love. We believe in America. Thank you so much and God bless you all.  "
Mitt Romney,2/7/2012,"Denver, Colorado Following the Minnesota and Colorado Caucuses",West,"Mitt Romney, Remarks in Denver, Colorado Following the Minnesota and Colorado Caucuses and the Missouri Primary Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/300152","Thank you, Colorado! I congratulate my fellow Republicans, and I look forward to the contests to come. We will take our message of liberty and prosperity to every corner of the country. And when this primary season is over, we will stand united to defeat Barack Obama and restore the values that have made America the greatest nation on earth. Three years ago, Barack Obama came to Colorado to accept his Party's nomination. He rented out a huge stadium. He hauled in some Styrofoam Greek columns and two giant screens to set the mood. On that big stage in Denver, he made some even bigger promises. He said the “Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress.” Under his definition, progress would be measured by ""how many people can find a job that pays a mortgage."" More Americans have lost their jobs during President Obama's term than during any other in modern history. And more Americans have lost their homes during President Obama's term than during any other in modern history. Under his own definition, President Obama has failed. We will succeed! In that same speech in Denver, candidate Obama said progress would be determined by “whether the average American family saw its income go up ... instead of down."" During the last four years, the median income has fallen by around 10%. Under his own definition, President Obama has failed. We will succeed! Candidate Obama went on to say that we could measure progress by ""whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business.” Have you seen what's happened to small business? Last year, under President Obama, there were almost 100,000 fewer new business start-ups than there were three years before. By his own definition, President Obama has failed. We will succeed! Candidate Obama said we could see progress in “an economy that honors the dignity of work.” Under President Obama, the average duration of unemployment has more than doubled and 14 million more people are on food stamps. By his own definition, President Obama has failed. We will succeed! This week, President Obama said that he deserves a second term because, and I quote, “We've made progress.” No, Mr. President, under the definition of progress you described here four years ago, you have not made progress. Three years ago, President Obama said that if he couldn't turn the economy around in three years, he'd be looking at a one-term proposition. Truer words could not have been spoken. This is a moment when our country cries out for fundamental change and reform. Washington cannot reform itself and Washington will never be reformed by those who have been compromised by the culture of Washington. This is a clear choice. I am the only person in this race — Republican or Democrat — who has never served a day in Washington. In the world I come from, leadership is starting a business, not trying to get a bill out of a subcommittee. I have said over and over that this campaign is about more than just replacing a President — it's about saving the soul of America. We all know in our hearts that soul is corrupted by a Washington culture of reckless spending, voting to raise your own pay, and saying you support term limits but always running for re-election. It's that Washington that we must change. This is not a moment when we can continue to do business as usual. This is not a moment when we can expect those in Washington to realize suddenly that they have been wrong and next time they will get it right. I stand before you ready to lead this party and this nation. I have led businesses. I have led an Olympics. I have led a state. President Obama says he is learning. We say, he is learning too little and too late. The presidency is not the place to learn how to lead. It is a place to exercise the judgment and leadership that has been learned over a lifetime. I know that many of us are concerned about our future. Over the last thirty years, I can't tell you how many times I've heard a situation is hopeless or a long list of all the reasons something can't be done. But I've never been very good at listening to those people and I've always enjoyed proving them wrong. It's one of the lessons I learned from dad. My father never graduated from college. He apprenticed, as a lath and plaster carpenter, and he was darn good at it. He learned how to put a handful of nails in his mouth and spit them out, point forward. On his honeymoon, he and Mom drove across the country. Dad sold aluminum paint along the way, to pay for gas and hotels. There were a lot reasons my father could have given up or set his sights lower. But Dad always believed in America; and in that America, a lath and plaster man could work his way up to running a little car company called American Motors and end up Governor of a state where he had once sold aluminum paint. For my Dad, America was the land of opportunity, where the circumstances of birth are no barrier to achieving ones dreams. In Dad's America, small business and entrepreneurs were encouraged, and respected. The spirit of enterprise, innovation, pioneering and derring-do propelled our standard of living and economy past every other nation on earth. I refuse to believe that America is just another place on the map with a flag. We stand for freedom and opportunity and hope. These last few years have not been the best of times. But while we've lost a few years, we have not lost our way. The principles that made us a great nation and leader of the world have notlost their meaning. They never will. We know we can bring this country back. I believe in America. And so do you. This election, let's fight for the America we love. We believe in America. Thank you. And God bless America.  "
Mitt Romney,2/10/2012,Conservative Political Action Conference,NA,"Mitt Romney, Remarks to the Conservative Political Action Conference Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/300160","This year, here at CPAC, we've got a great crowd. It's been a great conference. For that I suppose we should acknowledge President Obama, the conservative movement's top recruiter. Turns out, he really is a great community organizer. Although, I don't think we were the community he had in mind. Today we are poised for a great victory in November. The pundits and the pollsters tell us we can win this election. But we must tell the nation why we should win. It is up to us to prove that we are truly ready to step forward and lead this country. This election is not just about getting more votes. Defeating Barack Obama is only one step toward our greater goal of saving America. Of course we can defeat Barack Obama! That's the easy part! Believe me, November 6th will be the easiest day our next President will face. This country we love is in jeopardy. It's more than the economic statistics we read, it's the pain we feel in our hearts. For three years we have suffered through the failures not only of a weak leader, but of a bankrupt ideology. I am convinced that if we do our job, if we lead with conviction and integrity, that history will record the Obama Presidency as the last gasp of liberalism's great failure and a turning point for a new conservative era. But it's not enough to show how they have failed. We must prove we deserve to lead. I am here today to ask you to stand with me shoulder to shoulder as we go forward to fight for America. As we step forward together, now is the time to reaffirm what it means to be a conservative and why this must be our greatest hour. America is like no other country in history. At the very heart of our American conservatism is the conviction that the principles embodied in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence are uniquely powerful, foundational, and defining. Some see the hand of Providence in their authorship. Others credit the brilliance of the Founders. Many of us see both. But conservatives all agree that departing from these founding principles is a departure from the greatness of America-- from our mission, from our freedom, from our prosperity, and from our purpose. I know this President will never get it, but we conservatives aren't just proud to cling to our guns and to our religion. We are also proud to cling to our Constitution! The wisdom of our founding documents is that they see the nation's prosperity not as a product of government, but as the product of individual citizens, each pursuing happiness. This is key to the success of the American experiment. America does not just exist for the people, it has been made exceptional by the people. A free people, pursuing their own dreams and achieving success in their own ways — that is what has propelled America and made us the most prosperous and powerful nation in the world. Many politicians on both sides of the aisle have forgotten that — if they ever really understood it at all. They have fallen under the spell of Washington. Politicians are routinely elected on promises to change Washington, but when they come here, they become creatures of Washington. They begin to see government as the answer to every challenge and the solution for every problem. At every turn, they try to substitute the heavy hand of the federal government for free citizens and free enterprise. They think government knows better — and can do better — than a free people exercising their free will. And this President is the worst offender. Barack Obama is the poster child for the arrogance of government. This election really is a battle for the soul of America. And it's going to come down to a choice between whether we want to be a nation of and by Washington ... or a nation of and by a free people. As conservatives, we are united by a set of core commitments. But not everyone has taken the same path to get here. There are college students at this conference who are reading Burke and Hayek. When I was your age, you could have told me they were infielders for the Detroit Tigers. Some of you work in think tanks or follow the writings of prominent leaders. Some of you have worked in government or labored on the front lines of conservative causes. I salute you all. My path to conservatism came from my family, my faith, and my life's work. I was raised in a home shaped by and rooted in conservative values. My mother's father — my grandfather — came to America from England. As a teenager, he was alone in a new country, but he risked it all for a chance at religious liberty and economic opportunity. You've probably heard how proud I am of my father. He was born to American parents living in Mexico. When he was five, they moved back to the United States. His dad was a builder who went bust more than once. My Dad grew up poor and never had a chance to finish his college degree. But he believed in a country where the circumstances of one's birth were not a barrier to achievement. And with hard work, he became the head of a car company and the Governor of the great state of Michigan. The values that allowed my parents to achieve their dreams are the same values they instilled in my siblings and me. Those aren't values I just talk about; they are values that I live every day. My 42-year marriage to my wife, Ann; the life we've built with our five sons; and the faith that sustains us — these conservative constants have shaped my life. In business, if you're not fiscally conservative, you're bankrupt. I spent 25 years balancing budgets, eliminating waste, and keeping as far away from government as was humanly possible. I did things conservatism is designed for — I started new businesses and turned around broken ones. And I am not ashamed to say that I was very successful at it. I know conservatism because I have lived conservatism. As governor of Massachusetts, I had the unique experience of defending our conservative principles in the most liberal state in our union. When I took office, I was facing a $3 billion budget deficit and an economy in a tailspin. Even with a legislature that was 85% Democrat, I cut taxes 19 times and balanced the budget all four years. I cast over 800 vetoes and cut entire programs. I erased a $3 billion budget shortfall and left office with a $2 billion rainy day fund. If there was a program, an agency, or a department that needed cutting, we cut it. In fact, a commentator once said that I didn't just go after the sacred cows, I went after the whole herd. And I can't wait to get my hands on Washington. During my tenure, our conservative values also came under attack. Less than a year after I took office, the state's supreme court inexplicably found a right to same-sex marriage in our constitution. I pushed for a stay of the decision, fought for a marriage amendment to our constitution, and successfully prohibited out-of-state couples from coming to our state to get married and then go home. On my watch, we fought hard and prevented Massachusetts from becoming the Las Vegas of gay marriage. When I am President, I will preserve the Defense of Marriage Act and I will fight for a federal amendment defining marriage as a relationship between one man and one woman. During my time in office, I stood up to those who wanted to call into question the very definition of life. I vetoed a bill that would have opened the door to cloning and embryo farming. I vetoed a bill that would have allowed young girls to gain access to abortion-inducing drugs. I fought for abstinence education in our public schools. And I defended the Catholic Church's right to serve their community in ways that were consistent with their conscience through adoption programs that placed children in a home with a mom and a dad. I was a conservative governor. I fought against long odds in a deep blue state. I understand the battles that we, as conservatives, must fight because I have been on the front lines. Here at CPAC, I know you understand this. This gathering has always welcomed me. And you have consistently supported me — not because of my rhetoric, but because of my record. Over the course of this conference, several candidates either have been — or will come — before you seeking to lead our country out of these troubled times. What distinguishes us from one another is not our opposition to President Obama or even our support for conservative convictions. What distinguishes us is the nature of our experience, our perspective, and our judgment. This election will ultimately be about two very different visions for America. But our more immediate choice will be between candidates from two very different backgrounds. I spent 25 years in business, starting at the bottom and going on to help create a great American success story. I led an Olympics out of the shadows of scandal and turned around a state crying out for leadership. In each of these endeavors, I worked with many talented people, but I was the Chief Executive. Success or failure lay on my shoulders. When tough decisions had to be made, I made them. Leadership as a Chief Executive isn't about getting a bill out of subcommittee or giving a speech — it's about setting clear goals and overcoming constant adversity. It's about sharing credit when times are good and taking responsibility for failure. I am the only candidate in this race, Republican or Democrat, who has never worked a day in Washington. I don't have old scores to settle or decades of cloakroom deals to defend. As conservatives, you've learned to be skeptical of this city and its politicians and right you are. My wife and I raised five boys and one of the lessons you learn is that when you hear an excuse that just doesn't make sense... it's because it doesn't make sense. And let me tell you, any politician who tries to convince you that they hated Washington so much that they just couldn't leave, well, that's the same politician who will try to sell you a Bridge to Nowhere. This is a moment when our country needs serious change and real reform. So, let me tell you exactly what kind of President I will be. To get America back on track and get Americans back to work, we need bold and sweeping reforms. These are not managerial issues of changing this department or that agency. To change Washington, we must change the relationship between government and citizen. These are moral choices that will define us for generations to come. Today we borrow almost forty cents of every dollar we spend. That is unconscionable. It's unsustainable. It's reckless. It's immoral. And, if I am President, it will end. I will approach every spending decision by asking a few important questions: Can we afford it? And, if not, is it worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? As President, I will not just slow the growth of government, I will cut it. I will not just freeze government's share of the total economy, I will reduce it. And, without raising taxes or sacrificing America's military superiority, I will finally balance the budget. And that will start with the easiest cut of all — I will eliminate Obamacare. I will dramatically reduce the size of the federal workforce. And, for the first time ever, we will tie the compensation and benefits of federal workers to those in the private sector. The principle here is simple: public servants should not get a better deal than the citizens they serve. But cutting spending and bureaucracy alone won't be enough. In their current form, Social Security and Medicare are unsustainable. And we cannot afford to avoid our entitlement challenges any longer. I am the only candidate for President who has offered a sweeping, specific plan to save Social Security and reform Medicare. There are those who say you can't talk straight to the American people on these key issues and still win an election. I say we can, we must, and I will! These are sensible and critical reforms. Under my plan, no one at or near the retirement age will see any changes. And tax hikes are off the table. We will slowly and gradually raise the retirement age for Social Security — and, we will slow the growth in benefits for our nation's higher-income retirees. When it comes to Medicare, tomorrow's seniors should have the freedom to choose between traditional Medicare and a range of private plans. If these future seniors choose a more expensive plan, they would bear the additional cost. I know this President and his liberal allies will attack me for leading where he has failed. So be it. I will stand and fight — and we will win. He will attack us with the usual fear tactics, but we will remind Americans that during this President's term we have seen record high job losses and record home foreclosures. We will not be lectured to on values by the man whose ineptitude and failure has created so much unnecessary pain for our fellow Americans. Ours will not be the easy course. But it will be the right course. And I am confident that Americans are yearning for a President to do what is needed, not what is expedient. And let me be clear: Mine will be a pro-life presidency. On day one, I will reinstate the Mexico City policy. I will cut off funding for the United Nations Population Fund, which supports China's barbaric One Child Policy. I will ensure that organizations like Planned Parenthood get no federal support. And I will reverse every single Obama regulation that attacks our religious liberty and threatens innocent life. The Presidency is more than a public office; it is a sacred trust. As President, I will honor that trust by assuring that America remains the greatest military power on the face of the earth. This is very simple: If you do not want America to be the strongest nation on earth, I am not your President. You have that President today. This election is a defining moment for our generation and for the conservative movement. Make no mistake — we have an opportunity for Greatness but with that opportunity comes defining responsibility. We cannot use this election to refight past battles or reward our friends. I know that the fundamental change this moment demands will take fresh, bold conservative leadership with real world solutions based on real world experience. I will come to Washington, and, with your help and guidance and prayers, I will change Washington. And then I will leave Washington and go back to the life and family I love. I believe this is a moment that demands we return to our basic values and first principals. This is our moment. This is why we are conservatives. The task before us now is to reaffirm the convictions that unite us and go forward shoulder to shoulder to secure the victory America deserves. Thank you and God bless.  "
Mitt Romney,2/24/2012,"Detroit Economic Club in Detroit, Michigan",Midwest,"Mitt Romney, Remarks to the Detroit Economic Club in Detroit, Michigan Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/300226","Thank you, David, for that kind introduction. I appreciate that warm welcome. I want to thank Beth and her team at the Detroit Economic Club for hosting us. And I want to thank Ford Field for making room for us. It's good to be back home in Michigan. I was born in Harper Hospital, and I grew up here. I can remember my first day at the Hampton School. There were about thirty kids in our kindergarten class. And I imagine that as they dropped us off at the Hampton School each morning, our parents were confident that our future would be brighter and even better than their own. Our parents believed in America's promise. They believed that if you built a good home and taught your kids the right values, if you made sure your kids got an education and were willing to work hard, that your child's future would be prosperous and secure. In those days, we all believed that the future was full of possibility and prosperity. We felt the joyful optimism that comes from being raised in a land of opportunity, a place where — with risk and hard work — anyone can make a better life. That deep confidence in a better tomorrow is the basic promise of America. Today, that promise is being threatened by a faltering economy and a lack of presidential leadership. For 36 months, the unemployment rate has been over 8 percent. 24 million of our fellow Americans are struggling to find work. There are 3 million ""missing workers"" who have given up on finding a job altogether. Home values gone down, foreclosures are at a record high. Our debt is too great, and our opportunities too few. Everywhere I go in this campaign, I meet Americans who are really suffering in the Obama Economy. You can see it on their faces and hear it in their voices — they are anxious and scared about the future. I've met moms and dads who are struggling to get by. One works the day shift while the other works at night just so they can make ends meet. I've met kids who are about to graduate college; they're facing student loans and a bad economy, and they are worried that they won't be able to get a job. Everywhere I go, I hear stories that serve as sad reminders of this failed presidency. President Obama promised he would fix three things. First, he said he would hold unemployment under 8%; it hasn't been under 8% for 36 months. Then, he said he was going to cut the deficit in half; he's doubled it. Third, he said he'd make Medicare and Social Security solvent for future generations. Three years later, he still hasn't offered a serious proposal for either one. We have not seen a failure to communicate. We have seen a failure to lead. That's why I'm running for President. I want to restore America's promise. That means more jobs, less debt, smaller government. In the coming campaign, I am offering more than just a change in policy. I am offering a dramatic change in perspective and philosophy. Earlier this week, I put forward pro-growth tax reforms that will get our economy moving again. Today, this administration is focused on extending unemployment benefits. But what workers in Michigan and around the country really want is a good job and rising wages. Reforming the tax code is one of the surest and quickest ways to achieve that goal. First, I will make an across-the-board, 20% reduction in marginal individual income tax rates. By reducing the tax on the next dollar of income earned by all taxpayers, we will encourage hard work, risk-taking, and productivity by allowing Americans to keep more of what they earn. The businesses that pay taxes through the individual income tax system account for more than half of all private sector jobs in the United States. So this tax cut will encourage businesses to hire, raise wages, and grow the economy. Second, I will make our business taxation globally competitive. I will reduce the corporate tax rate to 25%. Currently, it's among the highest in the developed world; I will bring it in line with other nations. I will make the R&D tax credit permanent so we can encourage the kind of innovation that drives economic growth. And I will end the job-killing repatriation tax, so American companies who do business overseas will bring their profits here and invest at home. Third, I will promote savings and investment by maintaining the 15% rate on capital gains and dividends. I will eliminate the tax entirely for those with annual income below $200,000. These low tax rates will encourage Americans to save and invest — and they will encourage business investment and economic growth. Finally, I will repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax, and I will abolish the death tax. These changes will not add to the deficit. Stronger economic growth, spending cuts, and base broadening will offset the reductions. Middle-income Americans will continue to enjoy tax benefits that favor important priorities, including home ownership, charitable giving, health care, and savings. But there will be some changes in the current deductions and exemptions for higher-income Americans. Those who receive the greatest benefit from rate cuts will see the most significant limits. These reforms will grow our economy, increase wages, and create jobs. If we're going to get our fiscal house in order, however, we must also fix our nation's balance sheet. Today, we face $62 trillion in unfunded promises in our entitlement programs. We talk a lot about our $15 trillion of debt. And we've got to tackle that debt. But it's that $62 trillion in unfunded promises that keeps most of us up at night. A few commonsense reforms will ensure we make good on our promises to today's seniors while saving Social Security and Medicare for future generations. Tax hikes are off the table, and there will be no change for those at or near retirement. But younger generations will enter a system strengthened for the 21st century. When it comes to Social Security, we will slowly raise the retirement age. We will slow the growth in benefits for higher-income retirees. When it comes to Medicare, tomorrow's seniors will have a choice among insurance providers, including traditional Medicare. As with Medicare Part D today, the private sector will compete to offer insurance coverage at the lowest possible price. Seniors will then receive government support to ensure they can afford that coverage. And with Medicare, like with Social Security, lower-income seniors will receive the most generous benefits. Starting in 2022, new retirees will participate in this new system. We will gradually increase the Medicare eligibility age by one month each year. In the long run, the eligibility ages for both programs will be indexed to longevity so that they increase only as fast as life expectancy. With these commonsense changes, we will have fixed our balance sheet. Instead of $62 trillion in unfunded commitments hanging over America's future, we'll have a balance sheet that is actually in balance. My administration will also make the hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts necessary to reduce spending to 20% of GDP by the end of my first term. I will cap it there. And then, without sacrificing our military superiority, I will balance the budget. There are three ways I'll get this done. First, I'll cut programs. I will look at every government program and ask this question: Is this so critical that it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? Of course, we'll start with the easiest cut of all: Obamacare, a trillion-dollar entitlement we don't want and can't afford. It's bad medicine, bad policy, and when I'm President, the bad news of Obamacare will be over. We'll also cut things like subsidies to Amtrak and funding for Planned Parenthood. We'll repeal the union giveaway called the Davis-Bacon Act to save taxpayers over $10 billion per year. Second, we will return federal programs to the states. I will send Medicaid back to the states and cap that program's rate of growth. And I will do the same for other programs, like food stamps, housing subsidies, and job training. States are better equipped to perform all these functions. Once the economy is really growing again, I believe that we should return spending on these programs to pre-recession levels, cap their rate of growth, and give the states flexibility and control. Taxpayers would save money, and those in need would benefit from programs that are more effective, efficient, and responsive. Welfare reform showed us how well a state-led approach can work. Let's extend that conservative, small-government philosophy across the entire social safety net. Finally, government itself must be made more efficient. I will shrink the size of the federal workforce by 10% and link the pay and benefits of federal employees to those of their peers in the private sector. Public servants should not make more than the Americans who pay their salaries. This is a plan to get America back on track. And to get Michigan on track we also need to see a strong and vibrant auto industry. Let's learn from the lessons of the past. In my view, the industry got in trouble because the UAW asked for too much, management gave too much, and the government CAFE standards hurt domestic automakers. The result was a cost-penalty per vehicle of about $2,000. Even the best designers and engineers could not overcome that kind of cost disadvantage. As we look forward, the UAW must not imperil the future of the industry. CAFE standards must not be overly burdensome. The companies must invest in new technology and new markets. We should get government out of General Motors so that its future is determined by the demands of the marketplace, not the preferences of bureaucrats. And Detroit should not just be the Motor City of America. It must be the Motor City of the world. My economic plans will strengthen America — and strengthen Michigan. By making bold cuts in spending and commonsense entitlement reforms, we will make our government simpler, smaller, and smarter. Through pro-growth policies, we will get our economy back on track — and get our citizens back to work. Taken together, the plan I'm offering represents the biggest fundamental change to the federal government in modern history. These are conservative, pro-growth policies that will not only jumpstart our economy, but will stop the dangerous slide toward a society that values entitlement over opportunity. We will restore the promise of America. More jobs, less debt, smaller government. Now, I know that President Obama will criticize my proposal. So be it. I believe the American people are ready for real leadership. I believe they deserve a bold, conservative plan for reform and economic growth. Unlike President Obama, I actually have one — and I'm not afraid to put it on the table. My plan for America requires real leadership — and it calls for sacrifice. It does not require a leader to promise bigger and bigger benefits and something for nothing. It requires a leader to call for sacrifice. And if I'm elected President, I promise you this: Together, we will restore America's promise. Here in Michigan, the future will once again be full of promise and prosperity. Parents won't have to wonder if their children will have a better life. They'll know they will. Together, we will get our debt under control. We will pursue spending cuts that rein in the deficit, entitlement reforms that tackle our long-term debt, and a pro-growth tax policy that will create jobs, encourage private investment, and foster risk-taking and innovation. If we pursue the policies I've just described, you're going to see a Michigan with rising home values. Your kids will come out of college and find jobs that are consistent with their skills. Businesses will come here because of your unparalleled workforce. And Michigan will once again be known as an engine of innovation. I'm not promising that every day will be easy. But I am promising that every day things will get better. Together, we will make America strong again. But to do that, I need your help. Next Tuesday, I need your vote. If you want to make this election about restoring America's greatness, then I hope you will join me. If you believe the disappointments of the last few years are a detour, not our destiny, then I am asking for your vote. Together, let's put America on the path toward more jobs, less debt, and smaller government. Let's restore America's promise and create a new age of prosperity for the country that we love. Thank you. God Bless America.  "
Mitt Romney,2/28/2012,"Novi, Michigan Following Michigan and Arizona Primaries",Midwest,"Mitt Romney, Remarks in Novi, Michigan Following the Michigan and Arizona Primaries Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/299735","Thank you, Michigan. And thank you, Arizona! A week ago the pundits and the pollsters were ready to count us out. But across Michigan and Arizona I kept meeting moms and dads, students and grandparents, all concerned about what was happening to this great country. I was confident that we would come together today and take a giant step toward a brighter future. Tonight, their efforts have brought our cause a great victory. Tonight is all the more special because we're celebrating in the state where I was born, surrounded by Michiganders we consider family. Ann and I want to thank all of you who knocked on doors, made calls, and went to the polls. And in Arizona, we want to thank Governor Brewer and Senator McCain who are celebrating with our two sons, Craig and Matt. Our campaign is about restoring the promise of America. Last week, I unveiled a bold economic plan that will jumpstart this economy and help get Michiganders and Americans back to work. Americans are crying out for more jobs, less debt, and smaller government – and I will deliver. You know, a lot of people say that if you're running for office, you can't speak honestly with the American people. Well, I did – and I will – because this is a decisive moment that requires real leadership. Times are tough. And we need leaders who will live with integrity, who have the courage to tell the truth, and who have the experience to get our economy back on track. That's the kind of leader I am. And that's the kind of president I will be. Our campaign is about more than replacing a president. It's about restoring America's promise. From generation to generation, Americans have always known that the future would be brighter and better. Americans have always believed in a tomorrow full of possibility and prosperity. That's what it means to be a land of opportunity. In America, if you work hard, you can build a better life. If you teach your kids the right values and help them make the right choices, you know their future will be prosperous and secure. That deep confidence in a better tomorrow is the basic promise of America. Today, that promise is being threatened by a faltering economy and a failed presidency. Four years ago, we warned that the presidency was no place for on-the-job training. Today, we have an economy to prove it. This president likes to remind us that he inherited an economic crisis. But he never mentions that he also inherited a Democratic Congress. With majorities in the House and Senate, President Obama was free to pursue any policy he pleased. Did he fix the economy? Did he tackle the housing crisis? Did he get Americans back to work? No. He put us on a path toward debt, deficits, and decline. It is time to get off that path and get back on the path to prosperity. These days, when he's not spending our money or infringing upon our rights, President Obama is busy running for re-election. He believes he ranks among the top four presidents in history. He thinks he deserves a second term. He keeps saying, ""We can't wait."" To which I say, ""Yes, we can."" Today, we're $15 trillion in debt. Real unemployment stands at 15%. You've heard the saying, ""I need a vacation from this vacation?"" Well, we need to recover from this so-called ""recovery."" Americans survived a Great Depression. We weathered two world wars. We've made it through tough times before. And we have not come all this way to give up now. We still believe in the hope, the dream, and the promise of America. We know our future is better and brighter than these troubled times. That unwavering conviction guides our campaign. It has rallied millions of Americans to our cause. And it's the message we will take to every corner of this country – from Ohio and Idaho to Georgia and Tennessee. We've seen enough of this president over the last three years to know that we don't need another four. President Obama believes he is unchecked by our Constitution. He is unresponsive to the will of our people. In a second term, he would be unrestrained by the demands of re-election. If there is one thing we cannot afford, it is four years of Barack Obama with nothing to answer to. His budget foreshadows what lies ahead. Runaway spending and record debt were just the warm-up act. For an encore, he wants to raise taxes on job creators and small businesses and families. We will not let him! In this campaign, I am offering a real choice and a new direction. I have a plan that will restore America's promise through more jobs, less debt, and smaller government. President Obama is making the federal government bigger, burdensome, and bloated. I will make it simpler, smaller, and smarter. He raised the national debt. I will cut, cap, and balance the budget. He passed Obamacare. I'll repeal it. He lost our AAA credit rating; I'll restore it. He rejected the Keystone Pipeline. I'll approve it. I will open up our lands for development, so we can finally get the energy we need at a price we can afford. When it comes to the economy, my highest priority will be worrying about your job, not saving my own. President Obama wants to raise your taxes. I will cut them. That starts with an across-the-board, 20% rate cut for every American. I will repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax and abolish the death tax. He's proposed tax increases on small businesses and job creators. I will lower the corporate tax rate to 25%. I will make the R&D tax credit permanent to foster innovation. And I will end the repatriation tax to return investment to our shores. Let's finally have a tax plan that puts people to work. President Obama's budget raises taxes on savings and investment. I will help America's middle class families save and invest tax-free. President Obama has yet to offer a single serious proposal for saving Medicare or Social Security. I have a plan to save both – and, unlike him, I have the courage to put my plan on the table. My plans will help create jobs and raise wages. They will strengthen entitlement programs for future generations. And they will not add to our deficit – they will abolish it. I have a plan to get our citizens back to work – and I have the experience to get our economy back on track. I spent 25 years in business. I have been the steward of an Olympics and the leader of a state. I've cut taxes 19 times. I've turned a budget shortfall into a windfall. I know how government kills jobs – and, yes, how it can help. And I stand ready to lead our party to victory – and our nation to prosperity. This is our time for choosing – and this is a choice we must get right. I have said it before – and I firmly believe – that this campaign is about saving the soul of America. This election will come down to two very different visions for our future. It's a choice between becoming a nation of and by Washington … and remaining a nation of and by a free people. A choice between an entitlement society … and a land of opportunity. A choice between squandering America's promise … and restoring that promise for future generations. If you want to make this election about restoring American greatness, then I hope you will join us. If you believe the disappointments of the last few years are a detour, not our destiny, then I need your support. I'm asking you to get out and vote. I'm asking you to go to mittromney.com and pledge your support. I'm asking you to join in the fight for our freedom – and ensure that tomorrow will be better than today. This election, let's restore America's promise. Let's fight for the country we love. Thank you. And God bless America.  "
Mitt Romney,3/19/2012,University of Chicago,Midwest,"Mitt Romney, Remarks at the University of Chicago: ""The Freedom to Dream"" Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/300777","Thanks to the University of Chicago for hosting us today.  It's good to see so many scholars from the School of Public Policy. And it is an honor to visit the campus that houses the Becker-Friedman Institute. Milton Friedman used to tell a story about a trip he took to Asia in the 1960s.  Some government officials there asked him to visit the site of a massive public works project.  When he got there, he saw thousands of workers trying to build a canal with shovels. Milton turned to one of the officials and asked him why there were so few machines.  The bureaucrat said, ""You don't understand.  This is a jobs program."" Milton replied, ""Oh, I thought you were trying to build a canal.  If it's jobs you want, then you should give these workers spoons, not shovels."" Milton Friedman knew what President Obama still has not learned, even after three years and hundreds of billions of dollars in spending:  The government does not create prosperity; free markets and free people do. For three years, President Obama has expanded government instead of empowering the American people. He's put us deeper in debt. He's slowed the recovery and harmed our economy.  And he has attacked the cornerstone of American prosperity:  our economic freedom. Today, I want to talk with you about why economic freedom is so critical — and how, as President, I will restore it in order to get our economy growing again. This November, we face a defining decision.  Our choice will not be one of party or personality. This election will be about principle.  Our economic freedom will be on the ballot.  And I intend to offer the American people a clear choice. I spent 25 years in business. My work took me to many countries.  I was often struck by the enormous differences in the wealth and well-being of people living in different nations.  I was interested in how nations that were so close to each other in terms of geography could be so different in terms of prosperity.  Take, for example, Mexico and the United States, Israel and Egypt, Chile and Ecuador. I read books that purported to explain the disparities between such nations. Jared Diamond argued it was largely due to their physical differences, their minerals and natural resources. But this only explained part of what I saw. Then I read a book by historian David Landes called The Wealth and Poverty of Nations. In it, he traces the rise and fall of the great civilizations in history. After about 500 pages of scholarly analysis, he concludes with this observation: ""If we learn anything from the history of economic development, it is that culture makes all the difference."" Culture. What is it about America's culture that made us the greatest economic power in the history of the earth? Many features come to mind: our work ethic, our appreciation for education, our willingness to take risk, our commitment to honor and oath, our family orientation, our devotion to a purpose greater than ourselves, our patriotism. But one feature of our culture that propels the American economy stands out: freedom. The American economy is fueled by freedom. Free people and their free enterprises are what drive our economic vitality. The Founding Fathers wrote that we are endowed by our Creator with the freedom to pursue happiness. In America, we would have economic freedom, just as we would have political and religious freedom. Here, we would not be limited by the circumstance of birth nor directed by the supposedly informed hand of government.  We would be free to pursue happiness as we wish. The Founders were convinced that millions of people, all freely choosing their individual occupations and enterprises, all pursuing their individual dreams, would produce great prosperity.  And, they were right. Economic freedom is the only force that has consistently succeeded in lifting people out of poverty.  It is the only principle that has ever created sustained prosperity. It is why our economy rose to rival those of the world's leading powers — and has long since surpassed them all. Today, however, our status and our standing are in peril because the source of our economic strength is threatened.  Over the last several decades, and particularly over the last three years, Washington has increasingly encroached upon our freedom. The Obama administration's assault on our economic freedom is the principal reason why the recovery has been so tepid — why it couldn't meet their projections, let alone our expectations.  If we don't change course now, this assault on freedom could damage our economy and the well-being of American families for decades to come. We see this attack on our freedom in every corner of the economy. Let's start with taxes. By their very nature, they reduce our freedom. Their only role in a free economy should be to fund services that are absolutely essential, such as national security, education, and the care of those who cannot care for themselves. And, yet, President Obama has proposed raising the marginal tax rate from 35% to 40%. He has proposed special breaks for his favorite industries, further increases for businesses he dislikes, and endless credits and subsidies intended to shape our behavior in this society. Think for a moment about what that does to the freedom to start a business or grow an enterprise. Last week, I spoke with an entrepreneur in St. Louis. He and his son make amplifiers for electric guitars, but they recently had to lay off their other two employees. He said that, by his calculation, government takes 65% of what his business earns. President Obama wants to take even more. If you invest your savings in a new business and are one of the fortunate few who see success — and make a profit — President Obama wants to take 40% of it.  And then add to that the payroll tax, the gas tax, and state and city income, property, and excise taxes.  And then factor in the regulatory burdens, whose costs far exceed the total of all income tax payments.  Pretty soon, those taxes and costs add up.  Businesses shut down.  Jobs disappear.  Entrepreneurs decide it's too risky and too costly to invest and to hire. Dodd-Frank is another example.  It's an 848-page behemoth that will be followed by thousands and thousands of pages of new regulations.  Regulations are necessary. But burdensome regulations serve only to restrict freedom and imperil enterprise. The victims of those regulations are not nameless, faceless banks.  They're the employees, the business owners, and the customers who rely on those financial institutions. This administration's burdensome regulations are even invading the freedom of everyday Americans.  Mike and Chantell Sackett run a small business in Idaho.  They saved enough money to buy a piece of property and build a modest home on it. But days after they broke ground, an EPA regulator told them to stop digging. The EPA said they were building on a wetland. But the Sacketts' property isn't on the wetlands register.  It sits in a residential area. Nevertheless, the EPA wouldn't let them appeal the decision.  It told the Sacketts they weren't allowed to go to court.  An unelected government bureaucrat robbed them of their freedom. They were given no recourse, no remedy.  They could do what the EPA wanted, or they could risk millions of dollars in fines. Under President Obama, those same bureaucrats are insinuating themselves into every corner of the economy. They prevent drilling rigs from going to work in the Gulf.  They keep coal from being mined. They impede the reliable supply of natural gas.  They even tell farmers what their 15-year-old sons and daughters can and can't do on the family farm. Will Rogers famously said, ""This country has come to feel the same when Congress is in session as we do when the baby gets hold of a hammer.  It's just a question of how much damage he can do with it before you can take it away from him."" Will Rogers was concerned about the damage Congress could do.  But today, our freedom is never safe — because unelected, unaccountable regulators are always on the prowl. And under President Obama, they are multiplying like proverbial rabbits. The number of federal employees has grown by 140,000 under this president. Those regulators do a lot of damage.  For every regulation, there are unintended consequences, underestimated costs, and unwanted influence from special interests.  And, of course, the bureaucratic impulse is to make more rules, never to reduce them.  All those regulations erode our freedom and stifle prosperity. Now, the Obama assault on economic freedom is not limited to actions against individuals and enterprises; it extends to its intrusion upon the free marketplace itself. When government rather than the market routinely selects the winners and losers, enterprises cannot predict their prospects, and free enterprise is replaced with crony capitalism. Solyndra, Ener1, Fisker, and Tesla are examples. When the government invested $500 million in Solyndra, you can imagine that scores of other solar energy entrepreneurs and enterprises either lost their investors or failed to find any. When the NLRB tried to shut down Boeing's plant in South Carolina, it sent a signal dissuading businesses of all kinds from making similar investments in right to work states, limiting their freedom. When General Motors shares were directed to the UAW, political payback replaced the rule of law, and the rule of law is fundamental to economic freedom. When the heavy hand of government replaces the invisible hand of the market, economic freedom is the inevitable victim. For centuries, the American Dream has meant the opportunity to build something new.  Some of America's greatest success stories are of people who started out with nothing but a good idea and a corner in their garage.  Too often today, Americans look at what it takes to start a business and they don't see promise and opportunity.  They see government standing in their way. The real cost isn't just the taxes paid and money spent complying with the rules.  It's the businesses that are never started, the ideas that are never pursued, the dreams that are deferred. We once built the interstate highway system and the Hoover Dam.  Today, we can't even build a pipeline. We once led the world in manufacturing, exports, and infrastructure investment.  Today, we lead the world in lawsuits. Labor unions once served as a symbol of worker rights, fair treatment, and a growing middle class.  Today, they too often represent the worst of special interests and crony capitalism. But, now, after spending three years attacking business, President Obama hopes to erase his record with a speech.  In a recent address, he said that, ""We are inventors.  We are builders.  We are makers of things.  We are Thomas Edison.  We are the Wright Brothers.  We are Bill Gates.  We are Steve Jobs."" The reality is that, under President Obama's administration, these pioneers would have found it much more difficult, if not impossible, to innovate, invent, and create. Under Dodd-Frank, they would have struggled to get loans from their community banks. A regulator would have shut down the Wright Brothers for their ""dust pollution."" And the government would have banned Thomas Edison's light bulb. Oh yeah, Obama's regulators actually did just that. Every great innovation, every world-changing business breakthrough begins with a dream. And nothing is more fragile than a dream. It is essential to the genius of America that we have developed a culture that nurtures these dreams and dreamers, that honors them and, yes, rewards them. There has always been something uniquely brilliant about America. I don't believe this President understands this fundamental secret of America. And day by day, job-killing regulation by regulation, bureaucrat by bureaucrat, he is crushing the dream and the dreamers. If we continue along this path, our lives will be ruled by bureaucrats and boards, commissions and czars.  That path erodes freedom.  It deadens the entrepreneurial spirit. Freedom is becoming the victim of unbounded government appetite — and so is economic growth, job growth, and wage growth.  As government takes more and more, there is less and less incentive to take risk, to invest, to innovate, and to hire. The proof is in this weak recovery.  This administration thinks our economy is struggling because the stimulus was too small.  The truth is we're struggling because our government is too big. I am running for President because I have the experience and the vision to get us out of this mess.  I am offering a real choice and a new beginning.  And I have a conservative economic plan that will deliver more jobs, less debt, and smaller government. My agenda takes America in the right direction.  It preserves freedom.  It encourages risk and innovation.  It fosters competition.  It allows Americans to pursue happiness as they choose — and will lead to greater opportunity. Instead of expanding the government, I will shrink it. Instead of raising taxes, I will cut them. Instead of adding more regulations, I will reduce them with an overriding concern: do they help or do they hurt jobs? That's just the beginning.  There is still more we can do.  Before we can create enduring prosperity, we must restore our economic freedom. To build a strong America, we must empower Americans to pursue happiness as they choose, not as government directs. We must restore the world's most competitive economy, not relinquish it to cronies and bureaucrats. We must elect a President who puts his faith in free people, in free enterprises — and in the founding principles that made this country the greatest nation in history. Together, let's restore America's promise by renewing our economic freedom.  Let us affirm our conviction that America is a land of opportunity and usher in a new era of enduring prosperity and American leadership. Thank you.  God bless America.  "
Mitt Romney,3/20/2012,"Schaumburg, Illinois",Midwest,"Mitt Romney, Remarks in Schaumburg, Illinois Following the Illinois Primary Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/300779","Thanks, you guys. So many great friends in this room and across Illinois. What a night. Thank you, Illinois. What a night. Wow.   And, of course, I'd like to congratulate my fellow candidates on a hard-fought contest here. I'd like to thank in particular the volunteers and our friends across the state and, frankly, in other states who've been working hard. I appreciate their unwavering support, through good times and bad. And tonight, we thank the people of Illinois for their vote and for this extraordinary victory. Thank you so much.   And, you know, elections are about choices. And today, hundreds of thousands of people in Illinois have joined millions of people across the country to join our cause. And this movement began on a small farm in New Hampshire on a sunny June day. We were surrounded by a small group of our friends and some supporters and family. We shared a conviction that the America we love was in trouble and adrift without strong leadership. And three years of Barack Obama have brought us fewer jobs and shrinking paychecks, but many of us believed we were in danger of losing something even more than the value of our homes and our 401(k)s. After years of too many apologies and not enough jobs, historic drops in income and historic highs in gas prices, a president who doesn't hesitate to use all the means necessary to force through Obamacare on the American public, but leads from behind in the world. It's time to say these words, this word: enough. We've had enough.   We -- we know our future. We know our future's brighter than these troubled times. We still believe in America. And we deserve a president who believes in us. And I believe in the American people.   Now, you know that yesterday I was giving a speech at the University of Chicago... ... not -- not very far from here, not far from where Professor Barack Obama taught law. [laughter] [booing] It was a speech on economic freedom. And as I was writing the speech, I thought to my lifetime of experiences. I've had a lot of opportunity to learn about the -- the unique genius of America's free enterprise system. It started, of course, with my dad. He didn't graduate from college. And he would tell me about his dad, who was a contractor. And you know about construction, up and down years. He -- he never quite made it, but he never gave up and raised great kids. Later, I helped start companies. And those began with just an idea, and somehow they made it through the difficult times and were able to create a good return for investors and thousands of jobs. And those jobs helped families buy their first homes. Those jobs put kids through school. Those jobs helped people live better lives, dream a little bigger. For 25 years, I lived and breathed business and the economy and jobs. I had successes and failures. But each step of the way, I learned a little bit more about what it is that makes our American system so powerful. You can't learn that teaching constitutional law at University of Chicago, all right?   You -- you can't even learn that as a community organizer. [laughter] The simple truth is that this president doesn't understand the genius of America's economy or the secret of the American economic success story. The American economy is fueled by freedom.   The history of the world has shown that economic freedom is the only force that has consistently lifted people out of poverty. It's the only principle that has ever been able to sustain prosperity. But over the last three years, this administration has been engaged in an all-out assault on our freedom. Under this president, bureaucrats prevent drilling rigs from going to work in the gulf. They -- they keep coal from being mined. They impede the reliable supply of natural gas. They even tell farmers what their kids are able to do on their farms. This administration's assault on freedom has kept this so-called recovery from meeting their projections, let alone our expectations. And now, by the way, the president is trying to erase his record with some new rhetoric. The other day he said this. He said, ""We are inventors. We are builders. We are makers of things. We are Thomas Edison. We're the Wright brothers. We're Bill Gates. We're still jobs."" Wait, I missed that. ""We are Steve Jobs."" [laughter] That's true. But the problem is: He's still Barack Obama. [laughter]   AUDIENCE: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! ROMNEY: And, you see, under Barack Obama, those pioneers he mentioned would have faced a very difficult time trying to innovate and invent and invest and create and build jobs. You see, under Dodd- Frank, they would have found it almost impossible to get a loan from their community bank. ROMNEY: And, of course, the regulators would have shut down the Wright brothers for dust pollution. [laughter] You know -- and -- and, of course, the government would have banned Thomas Edison's light bulb. Oh, by the way, they just did, didn't they? Right? Yeah.   Now, you know that the real cost of these misguided policies, these attacks on economic freedom, this intrusion of the government into our freedom, the -- the cost of that are the ideas that are not pursued and the dreams that aren't realized and, therefore, all the little businesses that don't get started and the tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of workers who don't get hired. For centuries, the American dream has meant the opportunity to build something new. Some of America's greatest success stories are -- are people who started out with nothing but a good idea and a corner in their garage. But too often today, Americans who want to start a business or launch a new venture, they don't see promise and opportunity. They see government standing in the way. And I'm going to change that. We're going to get government out of the way.   You know, we -- we once built an Interstate Highway System and the Hoover Dam. Now we can't even build a pipeline. [laughter] I mean, we -- we once led the world in manufacturing and exports, investment. Today, we lead the world in lawsuits. You know, when we replace a law professor with a conservative businessman as president, that's going to end.   I think -- I think you know this. Every great innovation, every world-changing business breakthrough begins with a dream. And nothing is more fragile than a dream. The genius of America is that we nurture those dreams and the dreamers. We honor them. And, yes, we reward them. That's part of what's uniquely brilliant about America. But day by day, job-killing regulation by job-killing regulation, bureaucrat by bureaucrat, this president is crushing the dream, and the dreamers and I will make sure that finally ends.   You know, the -- the proof -- the proof of the president's failure is seeing how tepid this economy -- this economic recovery is. I mean, this administration thinks that the economy's struggling because the stimulus wasn't large enough. [laughter] The truth is, the economy is struggling because the government is too big.   You -- you and I know something the president still hasn't learned. Even after three years and hundreds of billions of dollars of spending and borrowing, it is not the government that creates our prosperity. The prosperity of America is the product of free markets and free people, and they must be protected and nurtured.   So tonight was a primary, but November is the general -- general election. And we're going to face a defining decision as a people. Our choice will not be about party or even personality. This election will be about principle. Our economic freedom will be on the ballot. I'm offering a real choice and a new beginning. I'm running for president because I have the experience and the vision to get us out of this mess. We know...   Look, we -- we know what Barack Obama's vision is. We've been living it these last three years. My vision is very, very, very different than what his is. You see, I -- I see an America where the prospects for our children will be better than even those that we've enjoyed during our lives, where the pursuit of success by all of us will unite us, not divide us, when the government finally understands...  I see a time when we'll finally have a government that understands it's better for more people to pay less in taxes than for a very few to pay a lot more. And...   And I see an America where the values we pass on to our children are greater than the debts we leave them.   I see an America where poverty is defeated by opportunity, not enabled by a government check.   I see an America that is humbled -- excuse me -- I seen an America that is humble, but it is never humbled, that leads, but is never led. I see an America that is so unquestionably strong that no one in the world would ever think of testing the might of our military.   Today -- today, we took an important step towards that America. Tomorrow, we'll take another. Each day, we move closer not just to victory, but to a better America. Join us. Join us. Together, we're going to ensure that America's greatest days are still ahead.   Thanks, you guys. Thank you so much. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you.  "
Mitt Romney,3/30/2012,"Appleton, Wisconsin",Midwest,"Mitt Romney, Remarks in Appleton, Wisconsin: ""Freedom and Opportunity"" Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/300680","In 222 days, something pretty extraordinary is going to happen in the country. We'll have an election. Across this country, millions and millions of Americans will be able to do something that is really quite amazing: They will choose not only a President, but an entire House of Representatives and a third of the US Senate. The entire world will be watching us. And by around midnight on November 6th, maybe a little earlier or a little later, we'll know the results of millions of Americans exercising their right to vote and in doing so, making a choice so profound that it is very difficult for any of us to grasp. No one can predict the crisis the next President will confront nor what the world will look like at the end of the next President's term. In a world in which the economies of Athens, Wisconsin and Athens, Greece are connected, every decision becomes infinitely more complex. But I believe Americans face a fundamental choice in this election, a decision that is much more important than the candidates or the political parties. We should understand that we are selecting not just who should guide us but a choice between two distinct paths and destinies for our nation. In the days and months ahead, we should ask ourselves some very fundamental questions about who we are as a nation and who we are becoming. What does it mean to be an American in 2012? What will it mean in 2016 and beyond? Are we keeping faith with the great legacy — and trust — that has been handed to us by previous generations? And what America will we leave the next generation? This campaign will produce a deafening cacophony of charges and counter charges and by November 6th, most Americans will probably be afraid to turn on their TV. So now, in this quiet before the storm, let's start with some basic facts about which there can be no debate. Since Barack Obama became President, over 800,000 Americans have lost their jobs. Millions of Americans spent longer looking for a job than ever before. Long-term unemployment is the worst since the Great Depression. Over 46 million Americans are now living in poverty, more than ever before in our nation's history. In households with single moms, over 30% are living in poverty. Forty-six and a half million Americans are now on food stamps, another record. 2.8 million homes have been foreclosed on. New business startups are at the lowest level in 30 years. Over 2,000 Chrysler and GM dealerships have closed and 22 automobile manufacturing plants have been shuttered or idled.   Our yearly budget deficits are soaring and our national debt now stands at an all-time high. Barack Obama presided over the first trillion-dollar deficit in American history.  And he has repeated this dreadful distinction for each year he has been in office. For the first time since World War II, our national debt is greater than the size of our entire economy. Each American's share of the national debt stands at $50,000. President Obama did not cause the recession, but he most certainly failed to lead the recovery. His stimulus protected the government, not the people. It was promised to hold unemployment below eight percent. It did not. Barack Obama's stimulus was as ineffective as it was expensive. His Obamacare didn't help create jobs either. It discouraged small businesses and health companies from hiring new workers. And Dodd-Frank hurt the community banks that provide loans to small businesses.  But the ""Too Big To Fail"" banks are even bigger today. He failed to deliver on jobs, but on his goal to raise energy prices, he sure came through.  All in all, President Obama prolonged the recession and slowed the recovery. His economic strategy is a bust. These troubling facts are President's Obama's legacy and now our shared history. As much as we would like to, we can't undo what has happened these past years. The families who have lost their homes, the factories that have closed, the students who had to drop out of college and those who never could make it in the door, all those missed chances and lost opportunities can't be regained. And that's why it is important to understand one astonishing fact about this election: President Obama thinks he's doing a good job. No, I'm not kidding. He actually thinks he's doing a great job. An historically great job. According to the President, only Lincoln, FDR and Lyndon Johnson have accomplished more. And no, he didn't say that on Saturday Night Live. How can this be? Is it that the President is just so disconnected from what is happening across America that he doesn't grasp the real consequences of his failures? That answer is easy. The answer is yes. Of course. This is a President who was elected not on the strength of a compelling record but a compelling personality and story. There was much about the campaign of Barack Obama that appealed to many Americans. And though the reality has failed the hope and change he promised, he remains surrounded by true believers who attack anyone who challenges their power.  And, as we see each day, they will fight even more fiercely to hold on to that power. All of this is to be expected. That power loves power and never lets go easily is hardly new. And that a White House has lost touch, well, I think we've seen that once or twice before. But we should also remember that candidate Barack Obama pledged that he wanted to ""transform this nation."" And, unfortunately, that is exactly what he has been doing.  And that is one more reason why this election is so critical. The choice before us could not be more profound.  Barack Obama and I have fundamentally different visions for America. He has spent the last four years laying the foundation for a new Government-Centered Society.  I will spend the next four years rebuilding the foundation of our Opportunity Society, led by free people and free enterprises. Our different visions for America are the product of our values and our life experiences.   Barack Obama once said that his work as a community organizer motivated him to help ""communities that had been ravaged by plant closings.""  His desire to help others could not be more admirable but it's clear that he saw free enterprise as the villain and not the solution. The only real solution to help those communities devastated by lost jobs is more jobs. Barack Obama seems never to have understood the basic point that a plant closes when a business loses money. So when this President attacks businesses for making money, and when his policies make it more difficult for businesses to make money, he is also attacking the very communities he wanted to help. That's how it works in America. Or at least that's how it works when America is working. But under Barack Obama, America hasn't been working. The ironic tragedy is that the community organizer who wanted to help those hurt by a plant closing became the President on whose watch more jobs were lost than any time since the Great Depression. Instead of doing everything possible to promote the power of the free enterprise system to create jobs and get us out of this economic crisis, Barack Obama has promoted the power of government. The results have been predictably dismal, but he has ""transformed"" us, as he likes to say, closer to his vision of a Government-Centered Society. In Barack Obama's Government-Centered Society, the government must do more because the economy is doomed to do less. When you attack business and vilify success, you will have less business and less success. And then, of course the debate becomes about how much to extend unemployment insurance because you have guaranteed there will be millions more unemployed. In Barack Obama's Government-Centered Society, government naturally allocates the rewards. Tax breaks are bestowed not to make us more productive or to grow a stronger economy but to reshape the society into what is currently fashionable and politically correct. Because business is inherently suspect, government regulators who know better must oversee and direct business decision-making. In Barack Obama's Government-Centered Society, tax increases become not only a necessity but also a desired tool for social justice. In that world of shrinking means, there's a finite amount of money, and as someone once famously said, you need taxes to spread the wealth around. In Barack Obama's Government-Centered Society, government spending will always increase because there's no reason to stop it. There's always someone who is entitled to something more, and who will vote for anyone who will give them something more. In a Government-Centered Society, government dispenses the benefits, borrows what it can't take, and consumes a greater and greater share of the economy. Today, government at all levels consumes 38 percent of the total economy or G.D.P. If Obamacare is allowed to stand, government will directly control almost half of the American economy.  And through the increasing controls government has imposed on industries like energy and financial services, and automobiles, it will indirectly or directly control well over half of our total economy. One must ask whether we will still be a free enterprise nation and whether we will still have economic freedom. America is on the cusp of having a government-run economy. President Obama is transforming America into something very different than the land of the free and the land of opportunity. We know where that transformation leads. There are other nations that have chosen that path. It leads to chronic high unemployment, crushing debt, and stagnant wages. Sound familiar? I don't want to transform America; I want to restore the values of economic freedom, opportunity, and small government that have made this nation the leader it is. Freedom and opportunity have made America the most powerful economy in the world. They are the foundation of a nation with full employment, rising wages, and fiscal stability. The best thing we can do for the economic well-being of the people of America is not to grow government, it is to restore freedom and opportunity. It is opportunity that has always driven America and defined us as Americans. My grandfather was in the construction business and he never really made it himself.  But he helped convince my dad that he could accomplish anything he set his mind to. My dad didn't have the chance to finish college and he apprenticed as a lath and plaster carpenter. Based on that excellent training, he went on to turn around a great car company and later became governor of Michigan. My father made the most of opportunities that came before him, and by the time I came along — I was the fourth of four brothers and sisters — I had the chance to get the education my dad couldn't. I loved cars and was tempted to stay in Michigan and go into the car business but I knew I would always wonder if any success I had was due to my father. So when I got out of business school, I stayed in Massachusetts and got an entry-level job with the best company that would hire me. More importantly, I was married and on the way to having five sons. Over the next 25 years, my business career had many ups and downs, great successes, definite failures, but each step of the way I learned more about the transforming power of our great free enterprise system.   I'm not naïve enough to believe that free enterprise is the solution to all of our problems — nor am I naïve enough to doubt that it is one of the greatest forces of good this world has ever known.   Free enterprise has done more to lift people out of poverty, to help build a strong middle class, to help educate our kids, to make our lives better, than all of the government programs put together. If we become one of those societies that attacks success, one outcome is certain — there will be a lot less success. That's not who we are. The promise of America has always been that if you worked hard, and took some risks, that there was the opportunity to build a better life for your family and for the next generation. It's not government's role to guarantee that every one of us will achieve the success we seek. This nation was founded on the principle that we have a God-given right to pursue happiness. It is the pursuit that is guaranteed, not the result. It is the opportunity that is guaranteed, not the outcome. We are an Opportunity Nation. Over the centuries, men and women pursuing happiness in their own unique ways have made ours the leading economy in the world, and as we look to the future, I am absolutely confident that the principles that created our strength are the very ones that will preserve it. This means that government must be smaller and have strict limits placed on its power.  Obamacare violates both principles. I will repeal it. Taxes should be as low as possible, in line with those of competing nations, and designed to foster innovation and growth. That's why I will cut marginal tax rates across the board. Regulations are necessary, but they must be continuously updated, streamlined, and modernized. Regulators should see part of their job as protecting economic freedom, promoting enterprise, and fostering job creation. Workers should have the right to form unions, but unions should not be forced upon them. And unions should not have the power to take money out of their members' paychecks to buy the support of politicians favored by the union bosses. In short, government must make America the best place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, small business and big business — for job creators of all kinds. Business is not the enemy. It is the friend of jobs, of rising wages, and of the revenues government needs to care for the poor and the elderly, and to provide for the national defense.   Out-of-touch liberals like Barack Obama say they want a strong economy, but they really don't like businesses very much.  But the economy is simply the product of all the nations' businesses added together.  So it's like saying you love omelettes but don't like eggs. To build a strong economy that provides good jobs and rising wages and that reduces poverty, we need to build successful businesses of every kind imaginable.  And President Obama has been attacking successful businesses of every kind imaginable. Apple Computer and Microsoft weren't started to save the world and neither were General Motors or Alcoa. Nor were some of the companies I helped start like Staples or The Sports Authority. All of these great American enterprises were started because innovators had great ideas and great ambitions. They became great commercial ventures, which is another way of saying they made a lot of money. Not just for a few people but for many people. They helped people buy homes, go to school, retire, start other companies. We have always been the country where dreamers build dreams and where one dream helps launch another. And if those dreamers are rewarded with prosperity, we view that as a reason others would be encouraged to dream big as well. We have to understand that today much of the world is hungry for the big dreamers with big ideas. America must fight to grow these dreamers and innovators, and to attract those from other lands. My father had a favorite saying: ""Nothing is as vulnerable as entrenched success."" Today, because America has been so successful for so long, we seem to have forgotten what brought us here. America has become vulnerable to new competition, to looming debt, and to those who would substitute more government power for more freedom. We have made some bad choices and ignored the mounting threats. But if the hill is a little steeper before us, we have always been a nation of big steppers. In this last year, I have been all over this country, from student union cafeterias to kitchen tables, from factory breakrooms to boardrooms, and I've heard frustration and anger but rarely hopelessness. Many Americans have given up on this President but they haven't ever thought about giving up. Not on themselves. Not on each other. And not on America. We have a sacred duty to restore the promise of America. And we will do it.  We will do it because we believe in America. This Tuesday, join me. Join me in the next step toward that destination of November 6th, when across America we can give a sigh of relief and know that the Promise of America has been kept. The dreamers can dream a little bigger, the help wanted signs can be dusted off, and we can start again. And this time we'll get it right. We'll stop the days of apologizing for success at home and never again apologize for America abroad. Together we'll build the greatest America we have ever known, where prosperity is grown and shared, not limited and divided, an America that guarantees that ours is the door that innovation and greatness always knocks on first. There was a time — not so long ago — when each of us could walk a little taller and stand a little straighter because we had a gift that no one else in the world shared. We were Americans. That meant something different to each of us but it meant something special to all of us. We knew it without question. And so did the world. Those days are coming back. That's our destiny. Join me. Walk together this Tuesday. And take another step every day until November 6th. We believe in America. We believe in ourselves. Our greatest days are still ahead. We are, after all, Americans! God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.  "
Mitt Romney,4/3/2012,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",Midwest,"Mitt Romney, Remarks in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Following the Wisconsin, Maryland, and District of Columbia Primaries Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/301355","Thank you. Hey guys. Thank you. Congressman Ryan, he's a great leader, wonderful speaker, but he's not going to take Ann's place, I'm going to tell you that.   Thank you for providing the thank yous this evening, Congressman. Thank you all -- also to Senator Johnson and Congressman Sensenbrenner, appreciate their being here, the participation they've had in this process and thank you to Wisconsin, Maryland and Washington, D.C. We won them all.   This -- this really has been quite a night. We -- we won a great victory tonight in our campaign to restore the promise of America. And here in the heartland, you know you're not going to find Americans with bigger hearts than the people of Wisconsin.   You know, but as I've been traveling across the state, I've -- I've visited with far too many whose hearts are filled with anxiety about their future. So many good and decent people seem to be running harder just to stay in place. And -- and for many, no matter how hard they -- they're running, every day it seems to put them a little further behind. It's that way across so much of America, too much of America. Under this president's watch, more Americans have lost their jobs than during any other period since the Depression. Millions have lost their homes. A record number of Americans are now living in poverty. And the most vulnerable are the ones that have been hurt the most. Thirty percent of single moms are now living in poverty. New business startups -- and that's normally where we get job growth after a recession -- new business startups are down to the lowest level in 30 years. And of course, you know our national debt is at a record high. And when you drive home tonight and you stop by the gas station, just take a look at the prices. And then ask yourself, four more years of that? I agree. [laughter] And that's why it's important to understand one extraordinary fact about this election: President Obama thinks he is doing a good job. I'm not kidding. He actually thinks he is doing a great job. He thinks he's doing an historically great job, like Abraham Lincoln and LBJ and FDR, and no, he did not say this on ""Saturday Night Live,"" all righty? [laughter] It's enough -- it's enough to make you think that years of flying around on Air Force One, surrounded by an adoring staff of true believers, telling you that you're great and you are doing a great job, It's enough to make you think that you might become a little out of touch with that, and that's what's happened. This campaign is going to deal with many complicated issues. But there is a basic choice that we're going to face. The president has pledged to transform America. And he's spent the last four years laying the foundation for a new government-centered society. I will spend the next four years rebuilding the foundation of a opportunity society led by free people and free enterprises.   And you know, the different visions we have I think are a product of the different lives we've led, the life experiences, the values we have. When he was a community organizer and communities were hurt by plant closings, his reaction was to turn to the government for help. He saw free enterprise as the villain and government as the solution. He never seemed to grasp the very basic point that a plant closes when a business loses money. So today, when the president attacks business, and when his policies make it more difficult for business to grow and prosper, he's also attacking the very communities he had wanted to help. Or at least that's how it works when America is working. But under Barack Obama, America hasn't been working. The ironic tragedy is that the community organizer who wanted to help those that were hurt by a plant closing became the president on whose watch more jobs have been lost any time since the Great Depression. In Barack Obama's government-centered society, the government has to do more because the economy is doomed to do less, because when you attack business and you vilify success, you are going to have less business and less success. And then, of course, the debate becomes about how much to extend unemployment insurance because you've guaranteed there will be millions more unemployed. In Barack Obama's government-centered society, tax increases not only become a necessity, but also a desired tool for social justice. In that world of shrinking means, there is a finite amount of money. And as someone once famously said, you need to have some taxes to spread the wealth around. [laughter] In Barack Obama's government-centered society, government spending always increases because, well, why not? There's always someone who's entitled to something more and who's willing to vote for anyone who will give them something more. Now, by the way, we know where that kind of -- you know, that transformation of a -- of a free society into a government-centered society leads, because there are other nations that have followed that path. And it leads to chronic high unemployment, crushing debt and stagnant wages. This is beginning to sound familiar, isn't it? I don't want to transform America. I want to restore to America the economic values of freedom and opportunity and limited government that has made us the powerhouse of the world.   It's opportunity. It's opportunity, not a check from government -- it's opportunity that has always driven America and defined us as Americans. Now I am not naive enough to believe that free enterprise is a solution to all of our problems. But nor am I naive enough to doubt that it is one of the greatest forces for good this world has ever known. Free enterprise has done more to lift people out of poverty, to help build a strong middle class, to help educate our kids, and to make our lives better than all the programs of government combined.   If we become one of those societies that attack success, why not come as certain there will be a lot less success? And that's not who we are. The promise of America has always been that if you worked hard, had the right values, took some risks, that there was an opportunity to build a better life for your family and for your next generation. This means that government has to be smaller and have strict limits placed on its power. ObamaCare violates both those principles, and I will get rid of it.   Taxes have to be as low as possible and in line with those of the competing nations around the world, designed to foster innovation and growth, that's why I will cut marginal taxes across the board. I want to create good jobs in this country. Let's get the taxes down for employers. Now we, of course, understand in a free market that regulations are necessary and critical, but they have to be continuously updated, streamlined, modernized, and regulators have to see their job not just as cracking down on the bad guys but also as protecting economic freedom and promoting enterprise and fostering job creation. Washington has to become an ally of business, not the opposition of business.   Now workers should have the right to join unions. But unions should not be forced upon workers. And unions should not have the power to take money our of their members' paychecks to buy the support of politicians that are favored by the union bosses.   You know, out-of-touch liberals like Barack Obama say they want a strong economy, but in everything they do, they show they don't like business very much. But the economy, of course, is simply the product of all the businesses of the nation added together. So it's a bit like saying you like an omelet, but you don't like eggs. [laughter] You know, to build a strong economy that provides good jobs and rising wages and that reduces poverty, we have to build successful businesses of every kind imaginable. And President Obama has been attacking successful businesses of every kind imaginable. We have always been a country of dreamers, where dreamers can have dreams, where one dream helps launch another. And if those dreamers are rewarded with prosperity, we view that as a reason that other may be encouraged to dream big as well. Now these last few years have been difficult, made a lot worse by the mistakes and failures of the president's leadership. But if the hill before is a little steeper, we've always been a nation of big steppers. In this last year, I've been all over the country, from student unions to kitchen tables, from factory breakrooms to boardrooms. And I've heard frustration and anger, but rarely hopelessness. A lot of Americans have given up on the president. But they haven't thought about giving up, not on themselves, not on each other, and not on America.   We have a duty -- we have a duty placed upon our shoulders by the founders of the nation, a sacred duty to restore the promise of America, and we will do it. And we will do it because we believe in America. Tonight, I'm asking the good people of Pennsylvania, and New York, Rhode Island, Delaware and Connecticut to join me. Join me in the next step toward that destination of November 6th when across America we can give a sigh of relief and know that the promise of America has been kept. The dreamers can dream a little bigger. Help wanted signs can get dusted off and put in the front yard and we can start again. And this time we're going to get it right. We will stop the days of apologizing for success at home and never again apologize for America abroad.   Together, we will build the greatest America we've ever known, where prosperity is grown and shared, not limited and divided, an America that guarantees that ours is the door that innovation and greatness always knocks on first. There was a time not so long ago when each of us could walk a little taller and stand a little straighter because we had a gift that no one else in the world had. We're Americans. That meant something different to each of us, but something special to all of us. We knew it without question -- so did the people in the rest of the world -- those days are coming back. That's our destiny. So join me, walk together, take another step every day until November 6th. We believe in America. We believe in ourselves. Our greatest days are still ahead. We are, after all, Americans. God bless this country. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thanks, you guys. Thanks for the victory in Wisconsin and Maryland and District of Columbia. Thanks, you guys. Thank you.  "
Mitt Romney,4/4/2012,"Newspaper Association of America in Washington, D.C.",South,"Mitt Romney, Remarks to the Newspaper Association of America in Washington, D.C. Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/301347","Over the last ten months, I've come to know a good deal about some of the journalists who write for your newspapers. We've aired our dirty laundry together — sometimes literally as well as figuratively. We've bathed hour upon hour in the fine diesel aroma of a campaign bus. And we've shared more birthdays and holidays with each other than with our families. One of the reporters covering our campaign is Maeve Reston of the Los Angeles Times. For Maeve's birthday, I got her a cake and sang her a birthday song. For my birthday, she was kind enough to remind me that I'm now old enough to qualify for Medicare. In just the few years since my last campaign, the changes in your industry are striking. Then, I looked to Drudge or FOX or CNN online to see what stories were developing. Hours after a speech, it was being dissected on the Internet. Now, it's Twitter, and instantaneous reaction. In 2008, the coverage was about what I said in my speech. These days, it's about what brand of jeans I am wearing and what I ate for lunch. Most people in my position are convinced that you are biased against us. We identify with LBJ's famous quip that if he were to walk on water, your headline would read: ""President Can't Swim."" Some people thus welcome the tumult in your industry, heralding the new voices and the unfiltered or supposedly unbiased sources. Frankly, in some of the new media, I find myself missing the presence of editors to exercise quality control. I miss the days of two or more sources for a story — when at least one source was actually named. How your industry will change, I cannot predict. I subscribe to Yogi Berra's dictum: ""Forecasting is very difficult, especially when it involves the future."" But I do know this: You will continue to find ways to provide the American people with reliable information that is vital to our lives and to our nation. And I am confident that the press will remain free. But further, I salute this organization and your various institutions in your effort to make it not only free, but also responsible, accurate, relevant, and integral to the functioning of our democracy. Given the number and scale of our nation's current challenges, the November election will have particular consequence. It will be a defining event. President Obama and I have very different visions for America, both of what it means to be an American today and what it will mean in the future. The voters will expect each of us to put our respective views on the table. We will each make our case, buttressed by our experience. The voters will hear the debates, be buffeted by advertising, and be informed by your coverage. And hopefully after all this, they will have an accurate understanding of the different directions we would take and the different choices we would make. Of course, for that to happen, the candidates must be candid about their views and plans. And, in that regard, President Obama's comments to President Medvedev are deeply troubling. That incident calls his candor into serious question. He does not want to share his real plans before the election, either with the public or with the press. By flexibility, he means that ""what the American public doesn't know won't hurt him."" He is intent on hiding. You and I will have to do the seeking. Barack Obama's exchange with the Russian President raises all kinds of serious questions: What exactly does President Obama intend to do differently once he is no longer accountable to the voters? Why does ""flexibility"" with foreign leaders require less accountability to the American people? And, on what other issues will he state his true position only after the election is over? But instead of answering those vital questions, President Obama came here yesterday and railed against arguments no one is making — and criticized policies no one is proposing. It's one of his favorite strategies — setting up straw men to distract from his record. And while I understand why the President doesn't want to run on his record, he can't run from his record either. As I have said many times before, the President did not cause the economic crisis, but he made it worse. He delayed the recovery, and made it anemic. When he took office, millions of Americans looked to him to turn around the economy and lead us back to full employment. He failed these Americans. The first three rules of any turnaround are focus, focus, and focus. But instead of focusing his attention on the economy, he delegated the stimulus to Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid. The $787 billion stimulus included a grab bag of pet projects that had languished in Congress for good reason, for years. It was less a jobs plan and more the mother of all earmarks. The administration pledged that it would keep unemployment below 8%... it has been above 8% every month since. The President's attention was elsewhere--like a government takeover of healthcare and apologizing for America abroad. He handed out tens of billions of dollars to green energy companies, including his friends and campaign contributors at companies like Solyndra that are now bankrupt. President Obama's answer to our economic crisis was more spending, more debt, and more government. By the end of his term in office, he will have added nearly as much public debt as all the prior Presidents combined. No President had ever run a trillion dollar deficit. The ""New Normal"" the President would have us embrace is trillion dollar deficits and eight percent unemployment. Through it all, President Obama has failed to even pass a budget. In February, he put forward a proposal that included the largest tax increase in history, and still left our national debt spiraling out of control. The House rejected it unanimously. Of course, no fiscal challenge is greater than the one we face with entitlements. As the President himself acknowledged three years ago, this is not a problem that we can kick down the road any further. I'd be willing to consider the President's plan, but he doesn't have one. That's right: In over three years, he has failed to enact or even propose a serious plan to solve our entitlement crisis. Instead, he has taken a series of steps that end Medicare as we know it. He is the only President to ever cut $500 billion from Medicare. And, as a result, more than half of doctors say they will cut back on treating seniors. He is destroying the Medicare Advantage program, eliminating the coverage that millions of seniors depend on and reducing choice by two-thirds. To control Medicare cost, he has created an unelected, unaccountable panel with the power to prevent Medicare from providing certain treatments. The result will be fewer treatments and services available to patients in need, and nowhere else to turn. A couple of months ago, we saw a fascinating exchange on Capitol Hill that epitomized not only this administration's inaction on entitlements, but also its appalling lack of leadership. The President's Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, was testifying before Congress. And Congressman Paul Ryan — who, unlike this President, has had the courage to offer serious solutions to the problems we face — was pressing Geithner on the administration's failure to lead on entitlement reform. Geithner's response was this: ""We are not coming before you today to say we have a definitive solution to that long term problem. What we do know is we don't like yours."" Take a moment and think about that: We don't have a solution. All we know is we don't like yours. It almost makes one long for the days when the President simply led from behind. And now, in the middle of the weakest economic recovery since the Great Depression, the President purports to have experienced a series of election-year conversions. As President, he has repeatedly called for tax increases on businesses. Now, as candidate Obama, he decides that a lower corporate tax rate would be better. As President, he's added regulations at a staggering rate. Now, as candidate Obama, he says he wants to find ways to reduce them. As President, he delayed the development of our oil and coal and natural gas. Now, as candidate Obama, he says he favors an energy policy that adopts an all-of-the-above approach. Nancy Pelosi famously said that we would have to pass Obamacare to find out what was in it. President Obama has turned that advice into a campaign strategy: He wants us to re-elect him so we can find out what he will actually do. With all the challenges the nation faces, this is not the time for President Obama's hide and seek campaign. President Obama has said that he wants to transform America. I don't want to transform America; I want to restore the values of economic freedom, opportunity, and small government that have made this nation the leader it is. It is opportunity that has always driven America and defined us as Americans. My grandfather was in the construction business and he never really made it himself. But he convinced my dad that he could accomplish anything he set his mind to. My dad didn't have the chance to finish college and he apprenticed as a lath and plaster carpenter. Based on that excellent training, he went on to turn around a great car company and later became governor of Michigan. My father made the most of opportunities that came before him, and by the time I came along — I was the fourth of four brothers and sisters — I had the chance to get the education my dad couldn't. I loved cars and was tempted to stay in Michigan and go into the car business but I knew I would always wonder if any success I had was due to my dad. So when I got out of business school, I stayed in Massachusetts and got a job with the best company that would hire me. More importantly, I was married and on the way to having five sons. Over the next 25 years, my business career had many ups and downs, great successes, definite failures, but each step of the way I learned more about the power of our great free enterprise system. I'm not naïve enough to believe that free enterprise is the solution to all of our problems — nor am I naïve enough to doubt that it is one of the greatest forces of good this world has ever known. Free enterprise has done more to lift people out of poverty, to help build a strong middle class, to help educate our kids, to make our lives better, than all of the government programs put together. If we become one of those societies that attack success, one outcome is certain — there will be a lot less success. That's not who we are. The promise of America has always been that if you worked hard, and took some risks, that there was the opportunity to build a better life for your family and for the next generation. I'm offering a clear choice and a different path. Unlike the President, I have a record that I am proud to run on. After my years in business, I used my experience to help save an Olympics and help turn around a state. When I became the governor of Massachusetts, the state budget was out of control and the legislature was 85% Democrat. We cut taxes 19 times and balanced the budget all four years. We erased a $3 billion budget shortfall and left office with a $2 billion rainy day fund. I cast over 800 vetoes and cut entire programs. If there was a program, an agency, or a department that needed cutting, we cut it. One commentator said that I didn't just go after the sacred cows; I went after the whole herd. And I can't wait to get my hands on Washington. Unlike President Obama, you don't have to wait until after the election to find out what I believe in — or what my plans are. I have a pro-growth agenda that will get our economy back on track — and get Americans back to work. This administration thinks our economy is struggling because the stimulus was too small. The truth is we're struggling because our government is too big. As President, I will get the government out of the way and unleash the power of American enterprise and innovation. Seven months ago, I presented a detailed plan for jobs and economic growth, including 59 different proposals that would help strengthen the economy. I understand some people are amused that I have so many ideas. But I think the American people will prefer it to President Obama's grand total of zero. I will cut marginal tax rates across the board for individuals and corporations, and limit deductions and exclusions. I will repeal burdensome regulations, and prevent the bureaucracy from writing new ones. I will unleash our domestic energy resources so that we can finally get the energy we need at a price we can afford. Instead of picking winners and losers with taxpayer dollars, I will make sure that every entrepreneur gets a fair shot and that every business plays by the same rules. I will create an environment where our businesses and workers can compete and win. I will welcome the best and the brightest to our shores, and ensure that we have labor and training policies that help American workers to be more competitive. Instead of growing the federal government, I will shrink it. I will repeal Obamacare, and cut programs that we cannot afford. I will send to the states those programs they can implement with better results at lower cost. I have already proposed a plan that will save and strengthen Medicare and Social Security for future generations. And, unlike President Obama, I have the courage to stand behind my plan and the leadership to enact it. My plan preserves these programs for those at or near retirement and strengthens them for future generations — without tax increases. I will gradually raise the retirement age for Social Security, and reduce the rate of benefit growth for tomorrow's higher income seniors. I will introduce market competition and consumer choice to Medicare, while also preserving traditional Medicare coverage as an option, so that future seniors can get higher quality care at lower cost. This November, we will face a defining decision. Our choice will not be one of party or personality. This election will be about principle. Freedom and opportunity will be on the ballot. I am offering a real choice and a new beginning. I am running for President because I have the experience and the vision to get us out of this mess. We know what Barack Obama's vision of America is — we've all lived it the last three years. Mine is very different. I see an America where we know the prospects for our children will be better than our own; where the pursuit of success unites us, not divides us; where the values we pass on to our children are greater than the debts we leave them; where poverty is defeated by opportunity, not enabled by a government check. I see an America that is humble but never humbled, that leads but is never lead. In this campaign, I will lead us toward that America. We wage this campaign as Republicans or Democrats, but we share a destiny as Americans. Together, we will ensure that America's greatest days are yet ahead. Thank you and God bless.  "
Mitt Romney,4/13/2012,"National Rifle Association National Convention in St. Louis, Missouri",Midwest,"Mitt Romney, Remarks to the National Rifle Association National Convention in St. Louis, Missouri Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/301368","Chris Cox, thank you for that kind introduction. And thanks to all of you for that warm welcome. It's great to be with so many friends from the National Rifle Association. This fine organization is sometimes called a single-issue group. That's high praise when the single issue is freedom. All of you can be proud of your long and unwavering defense of our constitutional rights and liberties. In 207 days, we'll do something that is really quite amazing: Americans will choose not only a President but an entire House of Representatives and a third of the US Senate. The entire world will be watching us. And by around midnight on November 6th, maybe a little earlier or later, we'll know the results of millions of Americans exercising their right to vote. In doing so, Americans will make a profound choice, a decision that is much more important than the candidates or the political parties. We will not just select the President who will guide us; we will also choose between two distinct paths and destinies for our nation. So many of the big issues in this campaign turn on our understanding of the Constitution and how it was meant to guide the life of our nation. It was one of Missouri's greatest sons, Harry Truman, who expressed a guiding conviction that you and I share. In a ceremony that placed the Constitution and Declaration in the permanent care of the National Archives, President Truman offered a word of caution. Liberty, he said, ""can be lost, and it will be, if the time ever comes when these documents are regarded not as the supreme expression of our profound belief, but merely as curiosities in glass cases."" Truman believed, as we do, that the principles of our Constitution are enduring and universal...that they were not designed to bend to the will of presidents and justices who come and go. The belief that we are all created equal, that we are endowed by our Creator with unalienable rights — these are not relics from another time, they reflect truths that are valid in every era. The framework of law created by the Declaration and the Constitution is the source of our greatness. It has generated unparalleled opportunity and prosperity. Our Founders understood this, which is why they created a system of government that is limited. This President is moving us away from our Founders' vision. Instead of limited government, he is leading us toward limited freedom and limited opportunity. This November, we face a defining decision. I am offering a real choice and a new beginning. I am running for President because I have the experience and the vision to lead us in a different direction. We know what Barack Obama's vision of America is — we've all lived it the last three years. Mine is very different. My course restores and protects our freedoms. As President, the Constitution would be my guide, and the Declaration of Independence my compass. Today, I want to talk about this administration's assault on our freedoms — our economic freedom, our religious freedom, and our personal freedom. And I want to share my plans to return America to the first principles of our founding. The American economy is fueled by freedom. Free people and their free enterprises are what drive our economic vitality. The Obama administration's assault on our economic freedom is the principal reason why the recovery has been so tepid — why it couldn't meet their projections, let alone our expectations. The President's assault on economic freedom begins with his tax hikes. By their very nature, taxes reduce our freedom. Their only role in a free economy should be to fund services that are absolutely essential, such as national security, education, and the care of those who cannot care for themselves. And, yet, President Obama has proposed raising the marginal tax rate from 35% to 40%. The Vice President has proposed a new global business tax. Medical device companies are soon to be subject to a new tax on revenues. And the President is now touring the country, touting a new tax on investment and the wealthy. Congress does not need more money to spend; Congress needs to learn to spend less! Dodd-Frank is another example of the President's attack on economic freedom. It's an 848-page behemoth that will be followed by thousands and thousands of pages of new regulations. Regulations are necessary. But burdensome regulations serve only to restrict freedom and imperil enterprise. The victims of those regulations are not nameless, faceless banks. They're the employees, the business owners, and the customers who rely on financial institutions that lose out. Under President Obama, bureaucrats are insinuating themselves into every corner of our economy, undermining economic freedom. They prevent drilling rigs from going to work in the Gulf. They keep coal from being mined. They impede the reliable supply of natural gas. They tell farmers what their children can and can't do to help on the farm. Will Rogers famously said that he worried whenever Congress was in session. Today, our freedom is never safe — because unelected, unaccountable regulators are always on the prowl. And under President Obama, they are multiplying. The number of federal employees has grown by almost 150,000 under this president. For centuries, the American Dream has meant the opportunity to build something new. Some of America's greatest success stories are of people who started out with nothing but a good idea and a corner in their garage. Today, Americans look at what it takes to start a business and they don't see promise and opportunity. They see government standing in their way. The real cost isn't just the taxes paid and money spent complying with the rules. It's the businesses that are never started, the ideas that are never pursued, the dreams that are never realized. We once built the interstate highway system and the Hoover Dam. Today, we can't even build a pipeline. We once led the world in manufacturing, exports, and infrastructure investment. Today, we lead the world in lawsuits. We once led the world in educating our kids. Today, half the kids in our fifty largest cities won't even graduate from high school. If we continue along this path, we'll spend our lives filling out forms, complying with excessive regulations and pleading with political appointees for waivers, subsidies and permission. That path erodes freedom. It deadens the entrepreneurial spirit. And it hurts the very people it's supposed to help. Freedom is the victim of unbounded government appetite — and so is economic growth, job growth, and wage growth. As government takes more and more, there is less and less incentive to take risk, to invest, to innovate, and to hire. This administration thinks our economy is struggling because the stimulus was too small. The truth is we're struggling because our government is too big. I am running for President because I have the experience and vision to get us out of this mess. My agenda takes America in the right direction. It preserves freedom. It encourages risk taking and innovation. It fosters competition. It promotes opportunity. Instead of expanding the government, I will shrink it. Instead of raising taxes, I will cut them. Instead of adding regulations, I will scale them back. The answer for a weak economy is not more government. It is more freedom! Economic freedom has not been the Obama administration's only target. Our first freedom — our religious freedom — has also been under attack. Recently, in a labor regulation case, the government claimed that a church should not be free to determine who qualifies as a minister under the law. It claimed that the government instead could interfere with that decision. The government! The Constitution came to the rescue: the Supreme Court rejected the Obama administration's attack, in a 9-0 unanimous decision. Now, the Obama administration has decided that it has the power to mandate what Catholic charities, schools, and hospitals must cover in their insurance plans. It's easy to forget how often President Obama assured us that under Obamacare, nothing in our insurance plans would have to change. Remember that one? Well, here we are, just getting started with Obamacare, and the federal government is already dictating to religious groups on matters of doctrine and conscience. In all of America, there is no larger private provider of healthcare for women and their babies than the Catholic Church. But that's not enough for the Obamacare bureaucrats. No, they want Catholics to fall in line and violate the tenets of their faith. As President, I will follow a very different path than President Obama. I will be a staunch defender of religious freedom. The Obamacare regulation is not a threat and insult to only one religious group — it is a threat and insult to every religious group. As President, I will abolish it. Like economic and religious freedom, our personal freedoms have been under attack. Few things are more important to us than our health, and our healthcare. The 10th amendment preserves the right to choose our own healthcare, and all rights not specifically granted to the federal government by the Constitution, to the states, and to the people. Obamacare violates the Constitution. I'm counting on the Supreme Court to say exactly that. But it's not just health care. Mike and Chantell Sackett have seen firsthand how the Obama government interferes with personal freedom. They run a small business in Idaho. They saved enough money to buy a piece of property and build a home. But days after they broke ground, an EPA regulator told them to stop digging. The EPA said they were building on a wetland. But the Sackett's property isn't on the wetlands register. It sits in a residential area. Nevertheless, the EPA wouldn't even let them appeal the decision. Fortunately, the Constitution confronted the Obama administration: the Supreme Court ruled unanimously for the Sacketts and against the Obama EPA. This administration's attack on freedom extends even to rights explicitly guaranteed by our Constitution. The right to bear arms is so plainly stated, so unambiguous, that liberals have a hard time challenging it directly. Instead, they've been employing every imaginable ploy to restrict it. I applaud true conservationists like Rob Keck who work to preserve lands, herds and flocks for hunting. I applaud Ambassador Bolton for opposing international efforts to erode our rights. I applaud Congressman Issa and Senator Grassley for their work in exposing the ""Fast and Furious"" scandal. And I applaud NRA leadership for being among the first and most vocal in calling upon Attorney General Holder to resign. We need a President who will enforce current laws, not create new ones that only serve to burden lawful gun owners. President Obama has not; I will. We need a President who will stand up for the rights of hunters, sportsmen, and those seeking to protect their homes and their families. President Obama has not; I will. And if we are going to safeguard our Second Amendment, it is time to elect a president who will defend the rights President Obama ignores or minimizes. I will. We've seen enough of President Obama over the last three years to know that we don't need another four. In a second term, he would be unrestrained by the demands of re-election. As he told the Russian president last month when he thought no one else was listening, after his re-election he'll have a lot more, quote, ""flexibility"" to do what he wants. I'm not exactly sure what he meant by that, but looking at his first three years, I have a very good idea. Consider the courts. President Obama has an unusual view of the Supreme Court and its responsibilities, as he reminded us just the other day. He said, quote, ""I'm confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress."" Of course, what President Obama calls ""extraordinary"" and ""unprecedented,"" the rest of us recognize as ""judicial review."" That concept has been a centerpiece of our constitutional system since 1803. Judicial review requires that the Supreme Court strike down any law that violates the Constitution — the founding document that is the bulwark of our freedoms. But President Obama seems to believe that Court decisions are only legitimate when they rule in his favor, and illegitimate if they don't. He thinks our nation's highest court is to be revered and respected — as long as it remains faithful to the original intent of Barack Obama. That's the problem with those who view the Constitution as living and evolving, not timeless and defining. They never explain just who will decide what the Constitution means and in which way it will ""evolve."" In his first term, we've seen the president try to browbeat the Supreme Court. In a second term, he would remake it. Our freedoms would be in the hands of an Obama Court, not just for four years, but for the next 40. That must not happen. As President, I will uphold the rule of law — and put America back on the path toward the Founders' vision. I don't want to transform America; I want to return America to the principles that made this nation great. Our Founders began this great American Experiment. They created a nation conceived in liberty and they entrusted us with the duty to preserve it and defend it. In the generations since, more than a million Americans have made the ultimate sacrifice. One day toward the end of my term, my office got a call telling us that a soldier had been killed in Iraq. His casket was on a U.S. Airways flight, but his family had not been notified in time to get to the airport and receive his body. I was asked if I could go to the airport in their stead. I said, of course. We drove over to the airport and on to the tarmac. The jet came in and the people disembarked. The luggage came down the conveyor, and then, after a little while, the casket appeared. The State Troopers who were there with me all saluted. I put my hand on my heart. And then I glanced up at the terminal. There's a big wall of glass at the U.S. Airways terminal in Boston right where the plane had come in. The people coming off the plane had seen the police cars, so they'd stopped to see what was going on. And then the people walking down the hall saw the people leaning up against the glass, so they pulled up behind them. A huge crowd had formed up there. Every single person had their hand on their heart. When I think of our country, scenes like this come to mind. Should I have the honor of serving as president, that's how I will seek to lead — not by pitting one group against another, but by bringing us together. Americans want a leader who will tell them the truth, who will live with integrity, and who will preserve this great nation — and protect our Constitution. We have a sacred duty to restore the promise of America. And we will do it. We will do it because we believe in America. We'll stop the days of apologizing for success at home and never again apologize for America abroad. There was a time — not so long ago — when each of us could walk a little taller and stand a little straighter because we had a gift that no one else in the world shared. We were Americans. That meant something different to each of us but it meant something special to all of us. We knew it without question. And so did the world. Those days are coming back. That's our destiny. We believe in America. We believe in ourselves. Our greatest days are still ahead. We are, after all, Americans! Join me in this great cause. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America"
Mitt Romney,4/24/2012,"Manchester, New Hampshire Following the Connecticut, Deleware, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island Primaries",Northeast,"Mitt Romney, Remarks in Manchester, New Hampshire Following the Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island Primaries Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/300786","Thank you Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York! And tonight I can say thank you, America. After 43 primaries and caucuses, many long days and more than a few long nights, I can say with confidence – and gratitude – that you have given me a great honor and solemn responsibility. And, together, we will win on November 6th! We launched this campaign not far from here on a beautiful June day. It has been an extraordinary journey. Americans have always been eternal optimists. But over the last three and a half years, we have seen hopes and dreams diminished by false promises and weak leadership. Everywhere I go, Americans are tired of being tired, and many of those who are fortunate enough to have a job are working harder for less. For every single mom who feels heartbroken when she has to explain to her kids that she needs to take a second job … for grandparents who can't afford the gas to visit their grandchildren … for the mom and dad who never thought they'd be on food stamps … for the small business owner desperately cutting back just to keep the doors open one more month – to all of the thousands of good and decent Americans I've met who want nothing more than a better chance, a fighting chance, to all of you, I have a simple message: Hold on a little longer. A better America begins tonight. Tonight is the start of a new campaign to unite every American who knows in their heart that we can do better! The last few years have been the best that Barack Obama can do, but it's not the best America can do! Tonight is the beginning of the end of the disappointments of the Obama years and the start of a new and better chapter that we will write together. This has already been a long campaign, but many Americans are just now beginning to focus on the choice before the country. In the days ahead, I look forward to spending time with many of you personally. I want to hear what's on your mind, hear about your concerns, and learn about your families. I want to know what you think we can do to make this country better…and what you expect from your next President. And I'll tell you a little bit about myself. I'll probably start out talking about my wonderful wife Ann – I usually do – and I'll probably bore you with stories about our kids and grandkids. I'll tell you about how much I love this country, where someone like my dad, who grew up poor and never graduated from college, could pursue his dreams and work his way up to running a great car company. Only in America could a man like my dad become governor of the state in which he once sold paint from the trunk of his car. I'd say that you might have heard that I was successful in business. And that rumor is true. But you might not have heard that I became successful by helping start a business that grew from 10 people to hundreds of people. You might not have heard that our business helped start other businesses, like Staples and Sports Authority and a new steel mill and a learning center called Bright Horizons. And I'd tell you that not every business made it and there were good days and bad days, but every day was a lesson. And after 25 years, I know how to lead us out of this stagnant Obama economy and into a job-creating recovery! Four years ago Barack Obama dazzled us in front of Greek columns with sweeping promises of hope and change. But after we came down to earth, after the celebration and parades, what do we have to show for three and a half years of President Obama? Is it easier to make ends meet? Is it easier to sell your home or buy a new one? Have you saved what you needed for retirement? Are you making more in your job? Do you have a better chance to get a better job? Do you pay less at the pump? If the answer were ""yes"" to those questions, then President Obama would be running for re-election based on his achievements…and rightly so. But because he has failed, he will run a campaign of diversions, distractions, and distortions. That kind of campaign may have worked at another place and in a different time. But not here and not now. It's still about the economy …and we're not stupid. People are hurting in America. And we know that something is wrong, terribly wrong with the direction of the country. We know that this election is about the kind of America we will live in and the kind of America we will leave to future generations. When it comes to the character of America, President Obama and I have very different visions. Government is at the center of his vision. It dispenses the benefits, borrows what it cannot take, and consumes a greater and greater share of the economy. With Obamacare fully installed, government will come to control half the economy, and we will have effectively ceased to be a free enterprise society. This President is putting us on a path where our lives will be ruled by bureaucrats and boards, commissions and czars. He's asking us to accept that Washington knows best – and can provide all. We've already seen where this path leads. It erodes freedom. It deadens the entrepreneurial spirit. And it hurts the very people it's supposed to help. Those who promise to spread the wealth around only ever succeed in spreading poverty. Other nations have chosen that path. It leads to chronic high unemployment, crushing debt, and stagnant wages. I have a very different vision for America, and of our future. It is an America driven by freedom, where free people, pursuing happiness in their own unique ways, create free enterprises that employ more and more Americans. Because there are so many enterprises that are succeeding, the competition for hard-working, educated and skilled employees is intense, and so wages and salaries rise. I see an America with a growing middle class, with rising standards of living. I see children even more successful than their parents – some successful even beyond their wildest dreams – and others congratulating them for their achievement, not attacking them for it. This America is fundamentally fair. We will stop the unfairness of urban children being denied access to the good schools of their choice; we will stop the unfairness of politicians giving taxpayer money to their friends' businesses; we will stop the unfairness of requiring union workers to contribute to politicians not of their choosing; we will stop the unfairness of government workers getting better pay and benefits than the taxpayers they serve; and we will stop the unfairness of one generation passing larger and larger debts on to the next. In the America I see, character and choices matter. And education, hard work, and living within our means are valued and rewarded. And poverty will be defeated, not with a government check, but with respect and achievement that is taught by parents, learned in school, and practiced in the workplace. This is the America that was won for us by the nation's Founders, and earned for us by the Greatest Generation. It is the America that has produced the most innovative, most productive, and the most powerful economy in the world. As I look around at the millions of Americans without work, the graduates who can't get a job, the soldiers who return home to an unemployment line, it breaks my heart. This does not have to be. It is the result of failed leadership and of a faulty vision. We will restore the promise of America only if we restore the principles of freedom and opportunity that made America the greatest nation on earth. Today, the hill before us is a little steep but we have always been a nation of big steppers. Many Americans have given up on this President but they haven't ever thought about giving up. Not on themselves. Not on each other. And not on America. In the days ahead, join me in the next step toward that destination of November 6th, when across America we can give a sigh of relief and know that the Promise of America has been kept. The dreamers can dream a little bigger, the help wanted signs can be dusted off, and we can start again. And this time we'll get it right. We'll stop the days of apologizing for success at home and never again apologize for America abroad. There was a time – not so long ago – when each of us could walk a little taller and stand a little straighter because we had a gift that no one else in the world shared. We were Americans. That meant something different to each of us but it meant something special to all of us. We knew it without question. And so did the world. Those days are coming back. That's our destiny. We believe in America. We believe in ourselves. Our greatest days are still ahead. We are, after all, Americans! God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.  "
Mitt Romney,5/8/2012,"Lansing, Michigan",Midwest,"Mitt Romney, Remarks in Lansing, Michigan: ""A New Course for America"" Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/300981","Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity to speak with the students here at the Lansing Community College. East Lansing was home for my parents and me during six years of the 1960's. And though I was away at school for most of that time, it holds fond memories for me. Much is the same as I remember it. Michigan State is still a major presence, and the capitol building continues to dominate the downtown. But a good deal has changed, most noticeably, the demise of Oldsmobile. It was a fine car and a source of pride for the city. It was also a source of a lot of good paying jobs. These last few years have been hard on the people of Lansing, and they have been hard on the people of America. In the Obama Economy, some of the hardest hit have been those in the middle class. Moms and Dads who used to sit down for dinner with the kids are now working different hours, and the kids eat pretty much on their own. Retirees who had saved and planned for retirement can't sell their home, and can't begin to live off the puny interest from their CDs. Young married couples who want kids don't see how they can possibly afford to have them. For a lot of folks, things like vacations, movies and restaurants are things of the past. I recently met with a Veterinarian and her husband. Her business has dropped 40%, not because she has lost clients, but because her clients can no longer afford to give their pets vaccinations and care. They have lost their home, and they have lost their clinic, but they have not lost their determination. They cut back, deeper and deeper, and they work, longer and harder. Americans are tired of living on the edge. Tired of worrying about what kind of country they are leaving their children. Americans are tired of being tired. This wasn't what we expected from President Obama. He promised change and hope, and said that he and we together could do anything. But rhetoric met reality, and reality won. His four years in office have been a disappointment for all of us, and they have been a catastrophe for some of us. In his campaign kickoff speech last week, he asked us not to think about these last four years. Convenient, but not convincing. Ignoring his record would bind us to repeat it. He is asking us, nevertheless, to look only to the years ahead, to consider how much better his policies will make things down the road. But in our hearts we know. As much as we'd like to believe him, we know that America is going in the wrong direction. Not forward, but sideways, or worse. We know that the mounting debt is a problem, not a blessing. We know that failing schools mean failing futures. We know that if more and more good jobs leave America, there won't be enough good jobs to succeed in America. This we know in our hearts--the lessons of the last four years teach us a great deal about the next years, if we continue in the same direction, with the same president. The President's plea that we simply ignore the last four years is his latest effort to escape responsibility for the failures. His earlier effort was to attempt to blame others – his predecessor, the Congress, the One Percent, oil companies, and ATMs. But the failures were not caused by others, they were caused by wrong choices, the President's choices. President Obama chose to apply liberal ideas of the past to a 21st century America. Liberal policies didn't work then, they haven't worked over the last four years, and they won't work in the future. New Democrats had abandoned those policies, but President Obama resurrected them, with predictable results. President Clinton said the era of big government was over. President Obama brought it back with a vengeance. Government at all levels now constitutes 38% of the economy, and if Obamacare is installed, it will reach almost 50%. President Clinton made efforts to reform welfare as we knew it. President Obama is trying tirelessly to expand the welfare state to all Americans, with promises of more programs, more benefits, and more spending. Old-school liberals saw a problem and thought a government-run program was the answer. Obamacare is the fulfillment of their dreams. Federal bureaucrats will tell all Americans what they have to have in their health insurance policies. And an unelected board will tell seniors what treatments Medicare will cover. Liberalism once taught that unions would ensure lasting prosperity for workers. Instead, they too often contributed to disappearing companies, disappearing industries, and disappearing jobs. But like many politicians of the past, President Obama takes his marching orders from union bosses, rails against right to work states, fights to win union elections by eliminating the vote by secret ballot, and even denies an American company the right to build a factory in the American state of its choice. The liberals of the past raised taxes, often with little thought of how they would hurt small business, and the economy. Like them, President Obama proposes to raise the tax on small business. He wants to increase the marginal tax rate paid by the most successful small businesses from 35% to 40%. It's a throwback to discredited policies, and it will kill jobs. Old-school liberals envisioned government guiding and providing every need of every citizen. Government would be at the center, the most important player in our lives. Have you seen President Obama's vision of the future? To help us see it, his campaign has even created a little fictional character, living an imaginary life filled with happy milestones for which she will spend the rest of her days thanking President Obama. It's called ""The Life of Julia."" And it is a cartoon. Julia progresses from cradle to grave, showing how government makes every good thing in her life possible. The weak economy, high unemployment, falling wages, rising gas prices, the national debt, the insolvency of entitlements – all these are fictionally assumed away in a cartoon that is produced by a president who wants us to forget about them. What does it say about a president's policies when he has to use a cartoon character rather than real people to justify his record? What does it say about the fiction of old liberalism to insist that good jobs and good schools and good wages will result from policies that have failed us, time and again? It is often asked why is this recovery the slowest on record? Why are American families having to suffer so much for so long? It's because the solutions that have been applied to the problem have been the wrong solutions. President Obama is looking in the wrong direction. Looking backward won't solve the problems of today nor will it take advantage of the opportunities of tomorrow. His are the policies of the past. The challenges of the present and the promise of tomorrow must be met by a new and bold vision for the future. I spent my business career at the leading edge of change. For my first ten years, I helped advise enterprises across the country as the economic world changed. Some companies were able to adapt to change, and others were not. Our task was always the same – to see the impact of change and to see the future in ways that others had not. That was also my task for the next 15 years of my life as I helped start new businesses or invested in businesses that needed to improve. We saw the immense opportunity for advertising on the Internet, the opportunity for super-stores in sporting goods and in office supplies, the opportunity for building a new steel mill even as old steel mills were shutting down. Finding solutions and opportunities in an environment of change and turbulence is what I learned in my career. And it is something I can bring to the presidency. This is a time for new ideas, new answers and a new direction. That is the only way that our future can be better than the past. Let me describe some of the policies of that new direction. I will be discussing these throughout this campaign. I will improve healthcare by getting it to work more like a consumer market, and I will repeal and replace Obamacare. Individuals will be able to buy their own health insurance policies, either through their employer or directly. And the kind of competition we see in everything from auto insurance to cell phones to broadband will finally slow the growth of healthcare costs. I will improve schools and universities and colleges with greater choice, greater accountability, and greater application of the technologies that have transformed so much of our economy. I will help usher in a revival in American manufacturing. If we take an entirely new and different direction in energy, in trade, and in labor policies, we will see more manufacturing jobs come back to America than those that are leaving America. I am absolutely convinced that with the right policies and leadership we can see a resurgence in American manufacturing. New and emerging small businesses and so-called gazelle, or fast-growing, businesses will spring up across the country by instituting pro-growth regulations, pro-growth taxes, pro-growth intellectual property protections, and pro-growth labor policies. We will re-build our failing infrastructure by merging public investment with private initiative. And as this new direction creates new jobs, it will also create the increasing demand for workers that will produce higher wages and better benefits. With the right direction and the right leadership, America can be reinvigorated as an economic powerhouse. And families can depend on stable jobs, rising home values, and more opportunity for their children. This can be more than our hope – it can be our future. The economic pressures that families feel today are not inevitable. It does not have to be this way. We are not the victims of forces beyond our control. We can choose our destiny. We are, after all, Americans. America is at a crossroads, one with the greatest economic divergence of the last hundred years. One path is that which President Obama has chosen. It ends with us becoming like much of Europe with chronic high unemployment, stagnant wages, and perilous levels of debt. If we continue in this direction, companies will continue to migrate away from America to job-friendly countries. Small businesses and start-ups will dwindle. And consumed by a desire to protect what little we have left, we will ignore the kinds of opportunities that created this great nation in the first place. I propose a different course, a new course unlike any of our past. It will draw on the creativity and invention of the world's most innovative citizenry. Government will be their partner, not their master. And government will be small enough for businesses to grow fast enough – fast enough to exploit the global opportunities in our changing world, fast enough to create better jobs, fast enough to provide our children with a future brighter than our past. The President is trying to breathe life into the failed policies of the past. We must instead invigorate the spirit of free people and free enterprises with a new vision for the future. I am increasingly optimistic about our future. I know the challenges we face as a nation are serious and grave. But while I understand our challenges, I've also seen our strengths. In this campaign, I've seen the fundamental goodness of our nation and of our people. I've seen the creative capacity of our entrepreneurs, the productivity of our workers, the unrivaled power of freedom. In our students, I've seen the leaders and innovators of tomorrow. They will do great things if we give them the freedom to dream big and the resources to create and build upon those dreams. Innovation is the heart and soul of American prosperity. We work on iPads, we take pictures with cell phones, we sell on virtual marketplaces, we have best friends on Facebook we have never met--all of these things were invented in America. And somewhere at a coffee shop, perhaps here in Lansing, a student is probably sketching out an idea that will change our lives in ways we can't imagine. I want that person to succeed beyond their wildest dreams. I want them to create thousands of new jobs. And out of their innovation will come other innovations, and more good jobs. This is how America works. At a time when technology is empowering people with more choices and more control over their lives than at any other time in history, this President's policies substitute government for individuality, for choice, for freedom. There is no app for freedom. It is what we live. Freedom gives us more choices, more prosperity, and better lives. We do not have to live with less. We can create more. This is America. I believe in America. I believe in the power of freedom to create a better future. Our children are counting on us. The world depends on us. And God willing, we will not disappoint them. God bless this great nation.  "
Mitt Romney,5/12/2012,"Romney in Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia ",South,"Mitt Romney, Commencement Address At Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/300967","For the graduates, this moment marks a clear ending and a clear beginning. The task set before you four years ago is now completed in full. To the class of 2012: Well done, and congratulations. Some of you may have taken a little longer than four years to complete your studies. One graduate has said that he completed his degree in only two terms: Clinton's and Bush's. In some ways, it is fitting that I share this distinction with Truett Cathy. The Romney campaign comes to a sudden stop when we spot a Chick-fil-A. Your chicken sandwiches were our comfort food through the primary season, and there were days that we needed a lot of comforting. So, Truett, thank you and congratulations on your well-deserved honor today. There are some people here who are even more pleased than the graduates. Those would be the parents. Their years of prayers, devotion, and investment have added up to this joyful achievement. And with credit to Congressman Dick Armey: The American Dream is not owning your own home, it is getting your kids out of the home you own. Lately, I've found myself thinking about life in four-year stretches. And let's just say that not everybody has achieved as much in these last four years as you have. That's a theme for another day. But two observations. First, even though job opportunities are scarce in this economy, it is not for nothing that you have spent this time preparing. Jerry Falwell, Senior, long ago observed that ""You do not determine a man's greatness by his talent or wealth, as the world does, but rather by what it takes to discourage him."" America needs your skill and talent. If we take the right course, we will see a resurgence in the American economy that will surprise the world, and that will open new doors of opportunity for those who are prepared as you are. Of course, what the next four years might hold for me is yet to be determined. But I will say that things are looking up, and I take your kind hospitality today as a sign of good things to come. I consider it a great life honor to address you today. Your generosity of spirit humbles me. The welcoming spirit of Liberty is a tribute to the gracious Christian example of your founder. In his 73 years of life, Dr. Falwell left a big mark. For nearly five decades he shared that walk with his good wife Macel. It's wonderful to see her today. The calling Jerry answered was not an easy one. Today we remember him as a courageous and big-hearted minister of the Gospel who never feared an argument, and never hated an adversary. Jerry deserves the tribute he would have treasured most, as a cheerful, confident champion for Christ. I will always remember his cheerful good humor and selflessness. Several years ago, in my home, my wife and I were posing for a picture together with him. We wanted him to be in the center of the photo, but he insisted that Ann be in the middle, with he and I on the sides. He explained, by pointing to me and himself, ""You see, Christ died between two thieves."" Maybe the most confident step Jerry ever took was to open the doors of this school 41 years ago. He believed that Liberty might become one of the most respected Christian universities anywhere on earth. And so it is today. He believed, even when the first graduating class consisted of 13 students, that year after year young Christians would be drawn to such a university in ever-greater numbers. And here you are. Today, thanks to what you have gained here, you leave Liberty with conviction and confidence as your armor. You know what you believe. You know who you are. And you know Whom you will serve. Not all colleges instill that kind of confidence, but it will be among the most prized qualities from your education here. Moral certainty, clear standards, and a commitment to spiritual ideals will set you apart in a world that searches for meaning. That said, your values will not always be the object of public admiration. In fact, the more you live by your beliefs, the more you will endure the censure of the world. Christianity is not the faith of the complacent, the comfortable or of the timid. It demands and creates heroic souls like Wesley, Wilberforce, Bonhoeffer, John Paul the Second, and Billy Graham. Each showed, in their own way, the relentless and powerful influence of the message of Jesus Christ. May that be your guide. You enter a world with civilizations and economies that are far from equal. Harvard historian David Landes devoted his lifelong study to understanding why some civilizations rise, and why others falter. His conclusion: Culture makes all the difference. Not natural resources, not geography, but what people believe and value. Central to America's rise to global leadership is our Judeo-Christian tradition, with its vision of the goodness and possibilities of every life. The American culture promotes personal responsibility, the dignity of work, the value of education, the merit of service, devotion to a purpose greater than self, and, at the foundation, the pre-eminence of the family. The power of these values is evidenced by a Brookings Institution study that Senator Rick Santorum brought to my attention. For those who graduate from high school, get a full-time job, and marry before they have their first child, the probability that they will be poor is 2%. But, if those things are absent, 76% will be poor. Culture matters. As fundamental as these principles are, they may become topics of democratic debate. So it is today with the enduring institution of marriage. Marriage is a relationship between one man and one woman. The protection of religious freedom has also become a matter of debate. It strikes me as odd that the free exercise of religious faith is sometimes treated as a problem, something America is stuck with instead of blessed with. Perhaps religious conscience upsets the designs of those who feel that the highest wisdom and authority comes from government. But from the beginning, this nation trusted in God, not man. Religious liberty is the first freedom in our Constitution. And whether the cause is justice for the persecuted, compassion for the needy and the sick, or mercy for the child waiting to be born, there is no greater force for good in the nation than Christian conscience in action. Religious freedom opens a door for Americans that is closed to too many others around the world. But whether we walk through that door, and what we do with our lives after we do, is up to us. Someone once observed that the great drama of Christianity is not a crowd shot, following the movements of collectives or even nations. The drama is always personal, individual, unfolding in one's own life. We're not alone in sensing this. Men and women of every faith, and good people with none at all, sincerely strive to do right and lead a purpose-driven life. And, in the way of lessons learned, by hitting the mark or by falling short, I can tell you this much for sure. All that you have heard here at Liberty University – about trusting in God and in His purpose for each of us--makes for more than a good sermon. It makes for a good life. So many things compete for our attention and devotion. That doesn't stop as you get older. We are all prone, at various turns, to treat the trivial things as all-important, the all-important things as trivial, and little by little lose sight of the one thing that endures forever. No person I have ever met, not even the most righteous or pure of heart, has gone without those times when faith recedes in the busy-ness of life. It's normal, and sometimes even the smallest glimpses of the Lord's work in our lives can reawaken our hearts. They bring us back to ourselves – and, better still, to something far greater than ourselves. What we have, what we wish we had – ambitions fulfilled, ambitions disappointed ... investments won, investments lost ... elections won, elections lost – these things may occupy our attention, but they do not define us. And each of them is subject to the vagaries and serendipities of life. Our relationship with our Maker, however, depends on none of this. It is entirely in our control, for He is always at the door, and knocks for us. Our worldly successes cannot be guaranteed, but our ability to achieve spiritual success is entirely up to us, thanks to the grace of God. The best advice I know is to give those worldly things your best but never your all, reserving the ultimate hope for the only one who can grant it. Many a preacher has advised the same, but few as memorably as Martin Luther King, Jr. ""As a young man,"" he said, ""with most of my life ahead of me, I decided early to give my life to something eternal and absolute. Not to these little gods that are here today and gone tomorrow. But to God who is the same yesterday, today, and forever."" In this life, the commitments that come closest to forever are those of family. My Dad, George Romney, was a CEO, a governor, and a member of the President's Cabinet. My wife Ann asked him once, ""What was your greatest accomplishment?"" Without a moment's pause, he said, ""Raising our four kids."" Ann and I feel the same way about our family. I have never once regretted missing a business opportunity so that I could be with my children and grandchildren. Among the things in life that can be put off, being there when it matters most isn't one of them. As C.S. Lewis is said to have remarked, ""The home is the ultimate career. All other careers exist for one purpose, and that is to support the ultimate career."" Promotions often mark the high points in a career, and I hope I haven't seen my last. But sometimes the high points come in unexpected ways. I was asked to help rescue the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. I'm embarrassed now to recall that when this opportunity was first presented to me, I dismissed it out of hand. I was busy, I was doing well, and, by the way, my lack of athletic prowess did not make the Olympics a logical step. In fact, after I had accepted the position, my oldest son called me and said, ""Dad, I've spoken to the brothers. We saw the paper this morning. We want you to know there's not a circumstance we could have conceived of that would put you on the front page of the sports section."" The Olympics were not a logical choice, but it was one of the best and most fulfilling choices of my life. Opportunities for you to serve in meaningful ways may come at inconvenient times, but that will make them all the more precious. People of different faiths, like yours and mine, sometimes wonder where we can meet in common purpose, when there are so many differences in creed and theology. Surely the answer is that we can meet in service, in shared moral convictions about our nation stemming from a common worldview. The best case for this is always the example of Christian men and women working and witnessing to carry God's love into every life – people like the late Chuck Colson. Not long ago, Chuck recounted a story from his days just after leaving prison. He was assured by people of influence that, even with a prison record, a man with his connections and experience could still live very comfortably. They would make some calls, get Chuck situated, and set him up once again as an important man. His choice at that crossroads would make him, instead, a great man. The call to service is one of the fundamental elements of our national character. It has motivated every great movement of conscience that this hopeful, fair-minded country of ours has ever seen. Sometimes, as Dr. Viktor Frankl observed in a book for the ages, it is not a matter of what we are asking of life, but rather what life is asking of us. How often the answer to our own troubles is to help others with theirs. In all of these things – faith, family, work, and service –the choices we make as Americans are, in other places, not choices at all. For so many on this earth, life is filled with orders, not options, right down to where they live, the work they do, and how many children the state will permit them to have. All the more reason to be grateful, this and every day, that we live in America, where the talents God gave us may be used in freedom. At this great Christian institution, you have all learned a thing or two about these gifts and the good purposes they can serve. They are yours to have and yours to share. Sometimes, your Liberty education will set you apart, and always it will help direct your path. And as you now leave, and make for new places near and far, I hope for each one of you that your path will be long and life will be kind. The ideals that brought you here ... the wisdom you gained here ... and the friends you found here – may these blessings be with you always, wherever you go. Thank you all, and God bless you.  "
Mitt Romney,5/15/2012,"Romeny in Des Moines, Iowa ",Midwest,"Mitt Romney, Remarks In Des Moines, Iowa Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/300970","Thank you all very much. It's good to be back in Iowa. So many friends here hold a special place in my heart. I've come here today to talk to you about an issue that affects the very heart of America. Of course, Iowa is much more than a collection of beautiful farms and small towns and cities bounded by two of America's great rivers. Iowa is a collection of the values that built America and that have sustained us through good times and bad. You know them well: hard work, taking care of our neighbors, family, faith in God and country. Common sense, kitchen table values. Not fancy, but enduring. These aren't the values that lead to out-of-control spending sprees, or to piling up massive amounts of debt you know your children – and grandchildren – will have to work all their lives to pay off. These aren't the values of putting off difficult decisions with the hope that maybe someone else will solve them. Today America faces a financial crisis of debt and spending that threatens what it means to be an American. Here in the heartland you know in your hearts that it's wrong. We can't spend another four years talking about solving a problem that we know we are making worse every single day. When the men and women who settled the Iowa prairie saw a fire in the distance, they didn't look around for someone else to save them or go back to sleep hoping the wind might blow another direction. They knew that their survival was up to them. A prairie fire of debt is sweeping across Iowa and our nation and every day we fail to act that fire gets closer to the homes and children we love. This is not solely a Democrat or a Republican problem. The issue isn't who deserves the most blame, it's who is going to do what it takes to put out the fire. The people of Iowa and America have watched President Obama for nearly four years, much of that time with Congress controlled by his own party. And rather than put out the spending fire, he has fed the fire. He has spent more and borrowed more. The time has come for a president, a leader, who will lead. I will lead us out of this debt and spending inferno. We will stop borrowing unfathomable sums of money we can't even imagine, from foreign countries we'll never even visit. I will bring us together to put out the fire! A lot of people think this is a problem we can't solve. I reject that kind of ""can't do"" defeatist talk. It's wrong. What's happened here isn't complicated. Washington has been spending too much money and our new President made things much worse. His policies have taken us backwards. Almost a generation ago, Bill Clinton announced that the Era of Big Government was over. Even a former McGovern campaign worker like President Clinton was signaling to his own Party that Democrats should no longer try to govern by proposing a new program for every problem. President Obama tucked away the Clinton doctrine in his large drawer of discarded ideas, along with transparency and bipartisanship. It's enough to make you wonder if maybe it was a personal beef with the Clintons....but really it runs much deeper. President Obama is an old school liberal whose first instinct is to see free enterprise as the villain and government as the hero. America counted on President Obama to rescue the economy, tame the deficit and help create jobs. Instead, he bailed out the public-sector, gave billions of dollars to the companies of his friends, and added almost as much debt as all the prior presidents combined. The consequence is that we are enduring the most tepid recovery in modern history. The consequence is that half of the kids graduating from college can't find a job that uses their skills. Half. The consequence is that retirees can no longer get by on savings and Social Security. The consequence is that the length of time it takes an unemployed worker to find a job is the longest on record. This is why even those who voted for Barack Obama are disappointed in him. Disappointment is the key in which the President's re-election is being played. Americans will not settle for four more years of the same melancholy song. We can and we must do better. President Obama started out with a near trillion-dollar stimulus package – the biggest, most careless one-time expenditure by the federal government in history. And remember this: the stimulus wasn't just wasted – it was borrowed and wasted. We still owe the money, we're still paying interest on it, and it'll be that way long after this presidency ends. Then there was Obamacare. Even now nobody knows what it will actually cost. And that uncertainty has slowed our economy. Employers delay hiring and entrepreneurs put the brakes on starting new businesses, because of a massive, European-style entitlement that Americans didn't want and can't afford. When you add up his policies, this President has increased the national debt by five trillion dollars. Let me put that in a way we can understand. Your household's share of government debt and unfunded liabilities has reached more than $520,000 under this president. Think about what that means. Your household will be taxed year after year with the interest cost of that debt and with the principal payments for those liabilities. Of course, it won't be paid off by the adults in your household. It will be passed along to your children. They will struggle throughout their lives with the interest on our debts--and President Obama is adding to them every single day. And that's the best case scenario. The interest rate on that debt is bound to go up, like an adjustable mortgage. And there's a good chance this debt could cause us to hit a Greece-like wall. Subprime mortgages came close to bringing the economy to its knees. This debt is America's Nightmare Mortgage. It is adjustable, no-money down, and assigned to our children. Politicians have been trying to hide the truth about this Nightmare Mortgage for years--just like liar-loans. This is not just bad economics; it is immoral. During my time in business and in state government, I came to see the economy as having three big players – the private sector, the states and localities, and the federal government. Of these three, the private sector is by far the most efficient and cost effective. That's because scores of businesses and thousands of entrepreneurs are competing every day to find a way to deliver a product or a service that is better than anyone else's. Think about smart phones. Blackberry got things going. Then Apple introduced the iPhone. Now the Android platform leads the market. In the world of free enterprise, competition brings us better and better products at lower and lower cost. Innovate and change or you go out of business. And the customer--us--benefits. Government doesn't begin to compare when it comes to change and improvements that provide better and less expensive services and products. But among governments, the states and localities are more responsive than the federal government, probably because there is a degree of competition between them. The slowest, least responsive sector is the federal government. Nobody hears ""Washington, D.C."" and thinks ""efficiency."" Imagine if the federal government was the sole legal supplier of cell phones. First, they'd still be under review, with hearings in Congress. When finally approved, the contract to make them would go to an Obama donor. They'd be the size of a shoe, with a collapsible solar panel. And campaign donors would be competing to become the all-powerful App Czar. My point is this: as President Obama and old-school liberals absorb more and more of our economy into government, they make what we do more expensive, less efficient, and less useful. They make America less competitive. They make government more expensive. What President Obama is doing is not bold; it's old. As president, I will make the federal government simpler, smaller, smarter – and, by the way, more in keeping with the vision of the Framers of our Constitution. This is why I do not, for one moment, share my opponent's belief that our spending problems can be solved with more taxes. You do not owe Washington a bigger share of your paycheck. Instead of putting more limits on your earnings and your options, we need to place clear and firm limits on government spending. As a start, I will lower federal spending to 20 percent of GDP within four years' time – down from the 24.3 percent today. The President's plan assumes an endless expansion of government, with costs rising and rising with the spread of Obamacare. I will halt the expansion of government, and repeal Obamacare. Working together, we can save Social Security without making any changes in the system for people in or nearing retirement. We have two basic options for future retirees: a tax increase for high-income retirees, or a decrease in the benefit growth rate for high-income retirees. I favor the second option; it protects everyone in the system and it avoids higher taxes that will drag down the economy. I have proposed a Medicare plan that improves the program, keeps it solvent, and slows the rate of growth in health care costs. Both of these reforms are relatively simple, compared to the far more difficult choices we'll face if we do nothing. Of course, Medicare and Social Security are also easy to demagogue, and I expect the President to continue doing that in this campaign. But Americans are on to that game, and I'm not going to insult voters by pretending that we can just keep putting off entitlement reform. I will continue to speak honestly, and, if elected, I will do what is right for the people of America. The President has made little effort to rein in redundancy and waste. In 2011, the Government Accountability Office found 34 areas where agencies, offices, or initiatives in the federal government had overlapping objectives or were providing similar services. The GAO estimated that fixing this redundancy could save over $100 billion. Yet, one year later, only three of these 34 areas had been fully addressed. Only one program was actually defunded. In 2010, 17 federal government agencies gave $7.7 billion to more than 25 United Nations programs, billions of it voluntarily. Another example: There are 94 federal programs in 11 agencies that encourage ""green"" building. A report found that the results of their initiatives and investments are, quote, ""unknown."" We see the same bureaucracy and overhead in our anti-poverty programs. Last year, the federal government spent more than $600 billion on more than 100 different programs that aim to help the poor. My approach to federal programs and bureaucracy is entirely different. Move programs to states or to the private sector where they can be run more efficiently and where we can do a better job helping the people who need our help. Shut down programs that aren't working. And streamline everything that's left. It's time for the people of America to take back the government of America. Entitlement reform, doing away with redundancy and waste, and shifting services and programs to the economic player who can deliver them best – these are all serious steps toward getting our debt and spending under control. But above all, we need to shake off the static big-government mindset of these past few years, and all the limits and regulations that go with it. We need a big turnaround here, and it requires a focused, unrelenting, long-term agenda for economic growth. Instead of leading the world in how much we borrow, America must continue to lead the world in how much we build, create, and invent. With all that we've been through these past few years, the challenges can seem awfully big, and some might look at America and wonder if we have lost our confidence. But confidence is not what is missing. All that's lacking now is direction and leadership. These have been years of disappointment and decline, and soon we can put them behind us. We can prosper again, with the powerful recovery we've all been waiting for, the good jobs that so many still need, and, above all, the opportunities we owe to our children and grandchildren. All of this can be more than our hope – it can be our future. It can begin this year, in the choice you make, so I ask for your help, your support, and your vote on the sixth of November. Thank you all, and God bless America.  "
Mitt Romney,5/18/2012,Cuban Independence Day,NA,"Mitt Romney, Videotaped Remarks On Cuban Independence Day Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/301423","Today, I join with the Cuban people—on the island, here in America, and elsewhere in the world—in honoring the independence that was so dearly won by brave Cubans over a century ago. The struggle for Cuban independence was based on the principles of liberty, and won through the courage and sacrifice that the yearning for freedom inspires. Today is a recognition of freedom's triumph, but it's also a sobering reminder that over 50 years of Cuba's history have been lost to the tyranny of the Castro regime. Since Castro took power, the Cuban people have been denied basic human freedoms. No freedom of religion, no freedom of the press, no political freedom. And the regime uses brutality and violence to suppress these freedoms and impose its will. In recent years and months, we have seen the deaths of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, Juan Wilfredo Soto, Wilman Villar and Laura Pollan at the hands of the dictatorship. We have witnessed the continued incarceration of peaceful pro-democracy activists and the unlawful imprisonment of Alan Gross. These injustices make painfully clear that the Castros' grip on power remains as tight as ever. The regime touts so-called ""reforms,"" but the facts point to continued oppression. The Cuban people still live in constant fear of a brutal totalitarian regime that has demonstrated time and again its utter disregard for basic human dignity. The fight for a free Cuba has gone on for far too long. Too many dreams have been shattered, too many lives have been ruined, and too many families have been separated by the tyranny of the Castro regime. Too many Independence Day celebrations have passed with that regime still clinging to power. And too many political leaders—on both sides of the aisle—have lauded the dream of a free Cuba on this day over the years, only to falter in realizing that dream once in office. In recent years, we have seen the United States back away from pressuring the Castro regime, under the misguided view that placating them with an open hand would yield progress. That naiveté has invited only more cruelty and oppression in return. Today, we join Cubans around the world in celebrating independence and remembering the brave men and women who gave their lives in the fight for freedom. And to those who continue the fight, I offer not only words of support, but the promise of action. If I am elected President, the Castro regime will have no reason to doubt our unwavering commitment to your cause. The regime will feel the full weight of American resolve. The international community will know that the future of Cuba is within the leadership of the Cuban pro-democracy movement, represented in men and women like Jose Daniel Ferrer, Jorge Luis Garcia Perez ""Antunez,"" Sara Marta Fonseca, and Berta Soler. And, together, we will hasten the day when the regime will come to an end. ""Like bones to the human body, the axle to the wheel, the wing to the bird, and the air to the wing, so is liberty the essence of life."" These were the words of Jose Marti at the time of Cuba's fight for independence. Those words rang true for Cuba a century ago. Soon, they will ring true once again.  "
Mitt Romney,5/23/2012,"Education at the Lation Coalition's Economic Summit in Washington, D.C.",South,"Mitt Romney, Remarks on Education at The Latino Coalition's Annual Economic Summit in Washington, D.C.: ""A Chance For Every Child"" Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/300977","Thanks to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for hosting us. This year the Chamber marks 100 years of Standing Up for American Enterprise. Few organizations have fought longer or harder for the principles of economic freedom. And these days, your voice is more important than ever. I am grateful to the Latino Coalition for the invitation to be part of your Annual Economic Summit. In recent days we've heard a lot about business from the President and if you're feeling like you deserve protection under the Endangered Species Act, I can't blame you. This is a time when everybody in this administration should be doing everything in their power to support you. If every one of our small businesses added just two employees, Americans could pay more mortgages and buy more groceries and fill their gas tanks. Instead, sadly, President Obama has decided to attack success. It's no wonder so many of his own supporters are calling on him to stop this war on job creators. Make no mistake, when I am President, you won't wake up every day and wonder if the President is on your side. Starting on Day One, I'll be there to help you make it. And if you're successful beyond your wildest dreams, I'll be the first to celebrate your success because I know your prosperity means greater opportunity – for you, for your families, for your employees, and for your communities. And that's what the American Dream is all about. During my lifetime, I've seen a few of my own dreams come true. I've run and started business, helped guide the Olympics, and led a great state. I learned early on that the only way to succeed in tough situations is to bring people together for a common purpose. That's how you achieve greatness and accomplish your goals. Dividing people and pitting one side against another produces nothing but failure and mediocrity. Unfortunately, we've seen too much of that from this administration. That's part of why we're facing the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. And it's why this President and his party have failed to address the most serious problems facing our country. When the President took office, he faced a jobs crisis. It's barely improved. He faced a spending crisis. It's only gotten worse. And he faced an education crisis. I'd love to stand here today and join you in celebrating the end of our education crisis. Wouldn't it be great if we could look back on the last four years with confidence that the crisis had been confronted and we'd turned the corner toward a brighter future? But sadly, that hasn't happened. And the tragedy is not just a matter of test scores and international rankings. It's the frustration of a sixth grader who wants to learn more, but is stuck in a class that's moving too slowly. It's the embarrassment of a 10th grader who knows he can't read the books he's assigned. It's the shame of a 12th grader who's supposed to be ready to graduate, but hasn't mastered the skills he or she needs to succeed in life. In this country, we believe every child has something to contribute. No matter what circumstances they were born into, every child has a dream about where they can go or what they can become. Whether that dream is to invent something, start something, build something, or create something, it all starts with the basic skills and confidence that only a good education can provide. Yet, today, too many dreams are never realized because our education system is failing. More than 150 years ago, our nation pioneered public education. We've now fallen way behind. Among developed countries, the United States comes in 14th of 34 in reading, 17th of 34 in science, and an abysmal 25th out of 34 in math. Our public education system is supposed to ensure that every child gets a strong start in life. Yet, one in four students fails to attain a high school degree. And in our major cities, half of our kids won't graduate. Imagine that. Imagine if your enterprise had a 25% to 50% failure rate in meeting its primary goal. You would consider that a crisis. You would make changes, and fast. Because if you didn't, you'd go out of business. But America's public education establishment shows no sense of urgency. Instead, there is a fierce determination to keep things the way they are. Here we are in the most prosperous nation, but millions of kids are getting a third-world education. And, America's minority children suffer the most. This is the civil-rights issue of our era. It's the great challenge of our time. Last week, I spoke about the prairie fire of debt that is spreading across our country. Today, I want to talk about our crisis in education. With all of our economic troubles, there's a temptation to put off the task of fixing our nations' schools for another time. But the jobs and housing failures of these past few years only make that task more important. Let's not kid ourselves – we are in the midst of a National Education Emergency. The only reason we don't hear more about it is because our economic troubles have taken our national attention away from the classroom. But if unemployment was where it should be and home values were going up, there is no question that the crisis in American education would be the great cause of this campaign. Of course, the jobs and housing failures of these past few years only make the need for educational improvement all the more critical. So I'll be blunt: I don't like the direction of American education, and as President, I will do everything in my power to reverse this decline. Much as you have in your own business careers, I've found that you can't expect dramatically different results unless you are open to dramatic change. As president, I will pursue bold policy changes that will restore the promise of our nation's education system. First, I will expand parental choice in an unprecedented way. Too many of our kids are trapped in schools that are failing or simply don't meet their needs. And for too long, we've merely talked about the virtues of school choice. As President, I will give the parents of every low-income and special needs student the chance to choose where their child goes to school. For the first time in history, federal education funds will be linked to a student, so that parents can send their child to any public or charter school, or to a private school, where permitted. And I will make that choice meaningful by ensuring there are sufficient options to exercise it. To receive the full complement of federal education dollars, states must provide students with ample school choice. In addition, digital learning options must not be prohibited. And charter schools or similar education choices must be scaled up to meet student demand. Instead of eliminating the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program as President Obama has proposed, I will expand it to offer more students a chance to attend a better school. It will be a model for parental choice programs across the nation. Parental choice will hold schools responsible for results, but parents can only exercise that choice effectively if they have good information. No Child Left Behind helped our nation take a giant step forward in bridging this information gap. But the law is not without its weaknesses. As president, I will break the political logjam that has prevented successful reform of the law. I will reduce federal micromanagement while redoubling efforts to ensure that schools are held responsible for results. For example, parents shouldn't have to navigate a cryptic evaluation system to figure out how their kids' schools are performing. States must provide a simple-to-read and widely available public report card that evaluates each school. These report cards will provide accurate and easy-to-understand information about student and school performance. States will continue to design their own standards and tests, but the report cards will provide information that parents can use to make informed choices. We will take bold steps to ensure our system welcomes and rewards the best teachers. As president, I will make it my goal to ensure that every classroom has a quality teacher. There are currently 82 programs in ten agencies that spend $4 billion on teacher quality. As president, I will consolidate these programs, and block grant them to states that adopt innovative policies. For example, states will be rewarded if they regularly evaluate teachers for their effectiveness and compensate the best teachers for their success. Teaching is a highly valued profession that must attract and retain the best and brightest. Dramatically expanding parental choice, making schools responsible for results by giving parents access to clear and instructive information, and attracting and rewarding our best teachers--these changes can help ensure that every parent has a choice and every child has a chance. Finally, since we live in a twenty-first century economy that increasingly demands a college education, efforts at improvement can't stop at high school's end. Students must have access to a wide variety of options that will give them the skills they need for successful careers. We must stop fueling skyrocketing tuition prices that put higher education out of reach for some and leave others with crushing debt. These are bold initiatives that will produce better outcomes for our parents and teachers and students. But accomplishing real change won't be easy. Efforts to truly reform our schools always meet strong resistance from entrenched interests. The teachers unions are the clearest example of a group that has lost its way. Whenever anyone dares to offer a new idea, the unions protest the loudest. Their attitude was memorably expressed by a long-time president of the American Federation of Teachers: He said, quote, ""When school children start paying union dues, that's when I'll start representing the interests of children."" The teachers unions don't fight for our children. That's our job. And our job keeps getting harder because the unions wield outsized influence in elections and campaigns. Annually, many teachers are forced to pay almost $1,000 in union dues. The two major teachers unions take in $600 million each year. That's more revenue than both of the political parties combined. In 2008, the National Education Association spent more money on campaigns than any other organization in the country. And 90% of those funds went to Democrats. Education is one issue where it should be easy to find common purpose and common solutions. And I believe the President must be troubled by the lack of progress since he took office. Most likely, he would have liked to do more. But the teachers unions are one of the Democrats' biggest donors – and one of the President's biggest campaign supporters. So, President Obama has been unable to stand up to union bosses – and unwilling to stand up for kids. The most recent example is the Opportunity Scholarship program. Since 2004, it's allowed thousands of children in the District of Columbia to escape one of the worst school systems in the nation and get a world-class education. Armed with scholarships of up to $7,500, students enrolled in private schools. 99% of them were African American or Hispanic. After three months, students could already read at levels 19 months ahead of their public-school peers. And parents were happy; for every spot in the program, there were 4 applications. Then, Senator Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, inserted a provision to end the program. The White House offered no resistance. In fact, the President has proposed ending all funding for Opportunity Scholarships. It must have gone against his better instincts, but the unions wanted it so he went along. In the Opportunity Scholarships, the Democrats finally found the one federal program they are willing to cut. Why? Because success anywhere in our public schools is a rebuke to failure everywhere else. That's why the unions oppose even the most common sense improvements. In Detroit, students in the city's failing public schools were offered a lifeline by a philanthropist who offered $200 million to create 15 charter schools. The teachers union made the state legislature turn that gift down. In Connecticut, parents groups tried to pass ""parent trigger"" legislation so they could take over and transform failing schools. A national teachers union moved fast to stop that. Now some union leaders will tell you that their objections are misunderstood. They'll argue the issues are complicated. But really it's simple – and it comes down to this: When your cause in life is preventing parents from having a meaningful choice or children from having a real chance, then you are on the wrong side. You might even be in the wrong vocation, because good teachers put the interests of children first. The same is true of a good president. In his speeches, President Obama likes to tell us ""we can't wait."" If only he would say that and mean it about education reform – because millions are waiting for change, and so many are missing their chance. The President can't have it both ways: He can't talk up reform, while indulging the groups that block it. He can't be the voice of disadvantaged public-school kids, and the protector of special interests. President Obama has made his choice, and I have made mine: As president, I will be a champion of real education reform in America, and I won't let any special interest get in the way. We have to stop putting campaign cash ahead of our kids. This is a battle we can and must win. And while a lot needs fixing, we're getting some of the most important things right. We have good teachers, like the ones who are leading New York City's Democracy Prep. Because of them, kids from the city's poorest community are outperforming children from the wealthiest. Last summer, these teachers took over the worst elementary school in Harlem rather than let it shut down. Democracy Prep is a testament to good people who refuse to give up on our kids or leave our cities without a fight. And leadership makes a huge difference. When Jeb Bush became governor of Florida, reading scores of Hispanic students in that state's school system were dismal. He brought focused innovation and passionate leadership. Today those scores have risen dramatically. But too often, new ideas, good teachers, and dedicated parents don't find a welcoming partner and true champion in elected officials like Governor Bush. Instead, they are met with resistance and resentment from the establishment. I know what it is like to be a Governor fighting to do things differently. You need every bit of help you can get. As President, I'll stand shoulder to shoulder with these reformers and innovators. When I became Governor, we were in the midst of instituting tough, bi-partisan education reforms. They included the requirement that every student pass a test to graduate from high school. The test came under attack from the unions. But we stood our ground. We also offered our best students a four-year, tuition-free scholarship to the state college of their choice. I called it the John and Abigail Adams Scholarship, after two Massachusetts citizens who understood the importance of education to our nation. Every year I'd ask a school principal to invite the students who scored in the top 25% on the exam to a special assembly. After some words about hard work, I'd ask them to reach under their chair and remove an envelope that had been taped there. And I'd watch as each of them would open the enclosed letter. Every year, I'd stand in front of the room and the same scene would unfold: At first, you could hear a pin drop. Then each student's eyes would get big and proud smiles would creep across their faces as they found out how well they had done on the exam. And then they would read the part of the letter where they learned they'd earned an Adams Scholarship. The smiles turned into cheers – and the sound was deafening. I got more hugs on Adams Scholarship day than I did at Christmas. Kids would bring me their cell phones so I could tell their parents the exciting news. And parents – more than once – told me that they had been worried they would not be able to afford college and that the scholarship would make a difference. Here in America, every child deserves a chance. It shouldn't be reserved for the fortunate few. If America is going to continue to lead the world in how much we build, create, and invent, then we must transform how we teach, train, and educate. We already have good teachers, engaged parents, and big ideas. What we need now is strong leadership and the political will. A choice for every parent means a chance for every child. That can be more than our hope – it can be our future. It can begin this year, in the choice you make, so I ask for your help, your support, and your vote on the sixth of November. Thank you all, and God bless America.  "
Mitt Romney,6/7/2012,"St. Louis, Missouri",Midwest,"Mitt Romney, Remarks in St. Louis, Missouri: ""A Champion For Free Enterprise"" Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/301000","Thank you. It is great to be here. We launched this campaign a little over a year ago. It's been a remarkable journey. I've traveled across this great country and had the privilege to visit with Americans from every walk of life. As those of the traveling press corps can attest, we've brought our campaign to every kind of business imaginable, from factory floors to lumber yards to warehouses of every shape and size. But whatever the business, everywhere I go, I hear frustration and disappointment in the lack of economic progress of the past three and a half years. Americans are tired of being tired. They're tired of working harder for less and now for the first time, more Americans are starting to think our future might not be as bright as our past. That lack of faith in the future is a bridge to despair that we cannot cross. An America that does not believe that tomorrow and tomorrow's tomorrow will be better is not the America we know and love. I've spoken often of the President's failures of policy. From the stimulus bill that gave us Solyndra but left us with record unemployment, to the job-crushing over-regulation of the EPA, to the smothering economic effects of Obamacare, this President's misguided policies have been muddled, confused and simply ineffective. When you look around at America's economy, three and half years into this presidency, it's painfully obvious that this inexperienced President was simply not up to the task of solving a great economic crisis. But today I want to speak to the road ahead and why I believe the disappointments of the past years have been a breach of faith with the American people. America is rightly heralded as the greatest experiment in self-governance in world history. We are all here today because of a startling conviction that free individuals could join together to decide their fate and that more freedom made us all stronger. Our example – and commitment – to freedom has changed the world. But along with the genius of our Declaration of Independence, our Constitution, and our Bill of Rights, is the equal genius of our economic system. Our Founding Fathers endeavored to create a moral and just society like no other in history, and out of that grew a moral and just economic system the likes of which the world had never seen. Our freedom, what it means to be an American, has been defined and sustained by the liberating power of the free enterprise system. That same system has helped lift more people out of poverty across the globe than any government program or competing economic system. The success of America's free enterprise system has been a bright beacon of freedom for the world. It has signaled to oppressed people to rise up against their oppressors, and given hope to the once hopeless. It is called the Free Enterprise System because we are both free to engage in enterprises and through those enterprises we ensure our freedom. But sadly, it has become clear that this President simply doesn't understand or appreciate these fundamental truths of our system. Over the last three and a half years, record numbers of Americans have lost their jobs or simply disappeared from the work force. Record numbers of Americans are living in poverty today – over 46 million of our fellow Americans are living below the poverty line. This is not just a failure of policy; it is a moral failure of tragic proportions. Our government has an absolute moral commitment to help every American help themselves and today, that fundamental commitment has been broken. I do not believe this has been done with evil intent or ill will. But for a family watching their house being sold at foreclosure, or the family that is forced to spend their kid's college savings just to make ends meet, the results are just as devastating. These are not statistics, these are our fellow Americans. As your President, starting on Day One, I will do everything in my power to end these days of drift and disappointment. There is something fundamentally wrong when there are over 23 million Americans who are unemployed, underemployed, or have stopped looking for work, and yet the President tells us he's doing a great job. I will not be that President of deception and doubt. I will lead us to a better place. For three and a half years, President Obama has expanded government instead of empowering the American people. He's put us deeper into debt. He's slowed the recovery and harmed our economy. And he has attacked the cornerstone of American prosperity: our economic freedom. Today, government at all levels consumes 37 percent of the total economy or G.D.P. If Obamacare is allowed to stand, government will reach half of the American economy. And through the increasing controls government has imposed on industries like energy, financial services and automobiles, it will soon effectively control the majority of our economic activity. One must ask whether we will still be a free enterprise nation and whether we will still have economic freedom. America is on the cusp of having a government-run economy. President Obama is transforming America into something very different than the land of the free and the land of opportunity. We know where that transformation leads. There are other nations that have chosen that path. It leads to chronic high unemployment, crushing debt, and stagnant wages. I don't want to transform America; I want to restore the values of economic freedom. So for every government-spending proposal, I will ask the following question: ""Is this program so important that it is worth borrowing more money from China to pay for it?"" With our nation facing 16 trillion dollars in debt, most times the answer will be an easy and unqualified ""no."" We've seen how fast our debt can grow. It's time to see how fast our economy can grow, and the first step is spending discipline. Instead of throwing more borrowed money at bad ideas, I will lower tax rates, simplify the tax code, and get the American economy running at full strength. Under President Obama, a single, massive law has spread so much uncertainty across the economy, especially to the small companies that employ about half of America's workers and create most of our new jobs. They have no idea how many more taxes and regulations are coming. And they sense from Washington an outright hostility toward what they do and what they hope to achieve. So, as president, I will begin with an equally big dose of certainty across our economy: By granting waivers to all fifty states, I will start the process of repealing Obamacare on Day One. In a free-enterprise system, we don't measure our success in equal outcomes, but instead in how well we preserve and promote the equality of opportunity. And this system has resulted in unrivaled prosperity and made America the greatest nation in history. President Obama's vision is very different – and deeply flawed. There is nothing fair about a government that favors political connections over honest competition and takes away your right to earn your own success. And there is nothing morally right about trying to turn government dependence into a substitute for the dignity of work. Where my vision believes in the ingenuity of the American people, his vision trusts the wisdom of political appointees and boards, commissions and czars. It's one in which ordinary Americans must get permission from people in Washington before they can buy, build, invest or hire. It's a world of federal mandates and waivers, tax credits and subsidies, federal grants and loan guarantees. It's an economy where a company's lobbyists will be more important than its engineers, and federal compliance lawyers will outnumber patent lawyers. Business models based on building a better mousetrap will give way to those that seek the right mix of government subsidies, waivers and loan guarantees. And Chief Government Officers will join the ranks of Chief Financial Officers and Chief Operating Officers in corporate America's executive ranks. President Obama trusts in the wisdom of government. I put my trust in the ingenuity and creativity and commitment to hard work of the American people. Looking at the sorry economic record of this administration, it's easy to lose heart, and even to give up – as so many have in their search for a job. The President and his team would like us to believe that somehow it's the fault of the free market that things haven't gone right. That's just another way of saying that it's your fault, and not theirs, that the real recovery hasn't yet arrived. We have waited, and waited, and waited for recovery. And enough time has passed to pronounce judgment on the economic policies of this administration. They have not worked. And you, the entrepreneurs and workers of America, have not failed these past three and a half years – your government has failed you. Never before has federal policy run so contrary to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the American entrepreneur. And with all that we've been through these past few years, the challenges can seem awfully big. Some might wonder if we have lost our confidence. But confidence is not what is missing – all that's lacking is direction and leadership. This President believes in an America of limits, where it is more important to focus on allocating the rewards of success than helping everyone succeed. That is an America of diminished opportunity and increased disappointment, of long unemployment lines and small dreams. I believe in a very different America. If we embrace the future with leadership that does everything possible to unlock the potential of our economic might, we can enter a new era of prosperity the likes of which we have never seen. We cannot shy away from greatness for fear that some might succeed more than others. Just as every American who can't find work makes our light shine a little less bright, success breeds success. It's not just our economy that is hurting -- it is our American spirit. It doesn't have to be this way. These have been years of disappointment and decline, and soon we can put them behind us. We can prosper again, with the powerful recovery we have all been waiting for, the good jobs that so many still need, and, above all, the opportunities we owe to our children and grandchildren. All of this can be more than our hope – it can be our future. It can begin this year, in the choice you make, so I ask for your help, your support, and your vote on the sixth of November. Thank you all, and God bless America.  "
Mitt Romney,6/15/2012,"Stratham, New Hampshire",Northeast,"Mitt Romney, Remarks in Stratham, New Hampshire Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/301008","Thank you for that warm welcome. It's great to be back in Stratham. And I'd like to thank Doug and Stella for welcoming us once again to their beautiful farm. Ann and I visited this farm a year ago when we launched our campaign for the Republican nomination. It was a beautiful day, and the start of a remarkable journey. Over the past year, it's become clear that good things begin here, so today we're back, with a few more friends and closer to the goal. Every day our campaign grows as more and more Americans realize that we don't have to settle for these years of disappointment and decline. America can do better – and with your help, we will. Together, we're going to take this campaign all way to the White House. Since last June, we've been to towns, big and small. We've visited businesses – some generations old, others quite new, every one of them trying to make the best of a bad economy. Across the country, people have welcomed us into their homes. We've enjoyed long talks about family and country in break rooms and backyards, in diners and on factory floors. Everywhere I go, I meet people who represent the best of America. They are hopeful, hard-working, determined and proud. But they are also worried and anxious. They are tired of being tired. And they are tired of a detached and distant President who never seems to hear their voices. When Americans rose up and demanded, ""Stop borrowing money and sticking our kids with the bill,"" the President wasn't listening. He was on the line with China, taking out another loan. When Americans went to town halls and said, ""We don't want Obamacare,"" the President ignored us, and spent fifteen months ramming his health-care bill through Congress on a party-line vote. And when we asked, ""Where is the recovery we were promised?"" this President lectured us saying ""The private sector is doing fine."" For so many Americans the distance between their town and the city of Washington has never seemed so far. The federal establishment has never seemed so hostile or remote – so disconnected from economic reality, and yet so willing to use restrictions and regulations, taxes and fines, commissions and czars to direct our daily lives. The President's plans have Americans wondering whether our future can be as bright as our past. But that lack of faith in our future is a bridge to despair that we cannot cross. That's why, from now until November, our campaign will carry a simple message: America's greatest days are ahead! Washington's big government agenda should not smother small-town dreams. In the America we love, every town counts. Every job counts. And every American counts! We're here today to launch a campaign bus tour that will take us from New Hampshire to Pennsylvania, then to Ohio and on to Iowa, Wisconsin and, finally, Michigan. In the days ahead, we'll be traveling on what are often called the ""backroads of America."" But I think our tour takes us along much of the ""backbone of America."" This is the America known for thriving farms and factories. For prosperous towns and cities and great colleges and universities. For solid communities and churches. All of them born out of American optimism; nourished and sustained by hard work and a belief that the American future is one of limitless possibilities and that opportunity is an American birthright. We will travel through the industrial heartland of America. This was once a model to the world for mining, manufacturing, and innovation. Many of the greatest commercial enterprises in the history of the world were born here. They gave birth to an extraordinary middle class which never questioned their ability to build a better life for their children. But in these past few years, too many of these Americans have been struggling and in distress. But even where factories have closed and jobs are too few, the spirit of enterprise -- the spirit that powered the engines of America's remarkable economic growth and prosperity -- that spirit still lives strong. And it is the goal of this campaign -- and will be the mission of my presidency -- to nurture that spirit and to see it flourish once again. The world knows the names of great cities like Pittsburgh, Detroit, Chicago and Cleveland. These were the arsenals of democracy, the forges of freedom, the melting pots of America. Their resilience and indomitable energy are a cornerstone of America's future. But we should never forget that some of America's biggest dreams were also born in our smallest communities. Our small towns have given us great writers, great thinkers, and great leaders. Before they were literary giants who dazzled the world, great American writers like Mark Twain and John Steinbeck were kids playing in wide-open spaces, dreaming up the stories they would tell. Before they were pioneers, Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers looked out into the dark night and up at the clear blue sky, imagining great inventions that would someday change the world. And, no, Mr. President, they were not dreaming of a government loan. And small towns gave us Lincoln and Truman, Eisenhower and Reagan – and so many sons and daughters who have sacrificed to defend our freedom on battlefields far away. The vision and the values, the character and the can-do spirit that you find in our small towns have made America great. In these places, you also find a special sense of community and a deep commitment to our country. These Americans are quiet heroes. They raise strong families, run our factories, and grow our food. They coach Little League and soccer. They serve on the PTA. They volunteer to help their neighbors. And they dream big dreams – sometimes for themselves, but mostly for their kids. Every town counts because the families who have lost a job, faced a foreclosure, or been forced to spend the money they were saving for college just to make ends meet are not statistics – they are our fellow Americans. In recent years, they have shown great determination and real bravery. These men and women do the hard things that others say aren't worth trying. They keep pressing on, even when government bureaucrats and regulations keep getting in their way. They have talent and creativity – and they aren't about to let their family or our country down by letting their dreams go. They are the backbone of America. Yesterday the President gave a speech. A Very. Long. Speech. You might have thought that it would be a moment when he would acknowledge his policy mistakes and suggest a new course. But no. He promised four more years, of more of the same. Four. More. Very. Long. Years. That's really the divide in this race. The President thinks we're on the right track and his policies are working. And I...I believe with all my heart that we can -- that we must -- do better! So let me ask where you stand. Do you believe America can do better? Do you believe that with new leadership and a new president our greatest days are still ahead? Do you believe we can take back the White House and reclaim the greatness of America? Somewhere in that long speech, President Obama spoke of giving people a ""fair shot."" I couldn't agree more. President Obama isn't giving our students a fair shot when they graduate and only half of them can find jobs or work that matches their skills. And he isn't giving the middle class a fair shot when wages keep going down and prices keep going up. Under Barack Obama, more Americans are living in poverty than under any President in history. That's a tragedy, not a fair shot! He didn't give the children of Washington, DC a fair shot when he proposed to end their scholarships to go to better schools. And when he bows to the demands of the teacher's unions, he isn't giving a fair shot to kids across America. He isn't giving entrepreneurs and job creators a fair shot when he picks winners and losers, rewarding campaign donors with tax dollars in scandals like Solyndra. Barack Obama isn't giving a fair shot to our children and grandchildren when he saddles them with trillions of dollars of debts. If there has ever been a president who has failed to give the middle class of America a fair shot, it is Barack Obama. I have a very different vision for America, and of our future. And I know what we must do to truly give our fellow Americans a fair shot...and a better chance. I see an America where free enterprise is nurtured and celebrated, not attacked, because freedom and free enterprise is what creates jobs, not government. I see an America with a growing middle class, with rising standards of living. I see children even more successful than their parents -- some successful beyond their wildest dreams -- and others congratulating them for their achievement, not attacking them for it. We must not allow the desperation of a failing Presidency to divide this great country. I see an America that is fundamentally fair, that cares for those who cannot care for themselves, that never wavers from our commitment to our seniors, and that gives our veterans the respect and care they richly deserve. In the America I see, character and choices matter. And education, hard work, and living within our means are valued and rewarded. And poverty will be defeated, not with a government check, but with respect and achievement that is taught by parents, learned in school, and practiced in the workplace. This is the America that was won for us by the nation's Founders, and earned for us by the Greatest Generation. It is the America that has produced the most innovative, most productive, and most powerful economy in the world. As I look around at the millions of Americans without work, the graduates who can't get a job, the soldiers who return home to an unemployment line, it breaks my heart. This does not have to be. It is the result of failed leadership and of a faulty vision. I am running for President because I have the experience and the vision to get us out of this mess. I am offering a real choice and a new beginning. We can't afford four more years of failed policies and weak leadership. Starting on Day One, I will do what it takes to get America back to work. Obamacare will end. We'll open markets around the world, and make sure that countries like China finally play by the rules. We'll get the Keystone Pipeline built and we'll send a message to the world that a new era of energy independence has begun right here on our continent. We'll replace the Obama job killing tax policies with sweeping tax reform to jumpstart job creation. The government regulators who are strangling small business will finally learn that job creators are our friends, not our enemies. And once again, the Era of Big Government will be over! No wonder Bill Clinton and so many other mainstream Democrats are revolting against the backward direction President Obama is taking his Party and our country! Let us make today the beginning of the end of the disappointments of the Obama years. Let us make today the start of a new and better chapter that we will write together. For every single mom who feels heartbroken when she has to explain to her kids that she needs to take a second job ... for every grandparent who can't afford the gas to visit the grandkids... for the mom and dad who never thought they'd be on food stamps ... for the small business owner desperately cutting back just to keep the doors open one more month... To all of the thousands of good and decent Americans I've met who want nothing more than a better chance, a fighting chance, to all of you, I have a simple message: Hold on a little longer. A better America begins today! Today the hill before us is a little steep but we have always been a nation of big steppers. Many Americans have given up on this President but they haven't ever thought about giving up. Not on themselves. Not on each other. And not on America. In the days ahead, join me in the next step toward that destination of November 6th, when across America we can give a sigh of relief and know that the Promise of America has been kept. The dreamers can dream a little bigger, the help wanted signs can be dusted off, and we can start again. And this time we'll get it right. We'll stop the days of apologizing for success at home and never again apologize for America abroad. There was a time – not so long ago – when each of us could walk a little taller and stand a little straighter because we had a gift that no one else in the world shared. We were Americans. That meant something different to each of us but it meant something special to all of us. We knew it without question. And so did the world. Those days are coming back. That's our destiny. Join me. Let's walk together, every day until November 6th. We believe in America. We believe in ourselves. Our greatest days are still ahead. We are, after all, Americans! God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.  "
Mitt Romney,6/21/2012,"National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in Orlando, Florida",South,"Mitt Romney, Remarks to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in Orlando, Florida Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/301003","Thank you for inviting me to your annual conference. It's an honor to be here among so many dedicated elected leaders. I come to you today as a candidate for President of the United States of America. I will govern from the principle that while this is a land of extraordinary diversity, there is much more that unites us than divides us. Though each of us walks a different path in life, we are united by one great, overwhelming passion: We love America. We believe in America. We are one nation, under God. Today, we are united not only by our faith in America. We are united also by our concern for America. This country we love is in peril. That is why I am running for President. Almost four years ago, Americans did something that was very much the sort of thing Americans like to do: We gave someone new a chance to lead; someone we hadn't known for very long, who didn't have much of a record but promised to lead us to a better place. At the time, we didn't know what sort of a President he would make. It was a moment of crisis for our economy, and when Barack Obama came to office, America wished him well and hoped for the best. Three and a half years later, over 23 million Americans are out of work, underemployed or have just quit looking for work. At a time when we should be gaining momentum, we're losing it. Job growth has slowed and this week, we learned that the number of job openings has fallen again. Hispanics have been hit disproportionately hard. While national unemployment is still above 8%, Hispanic unemployment is at 11%. The middle class has been crushed under President Obama. More Americans are living in poverty today than at any point in history. Over two million more Hispanics are living in poverty today than the day President Obama took office. Home values have plunged, our national debt is at record levels and families are buried under higher prices for food and gasoline. And yet our President says the private sector is doing fine. This is more than a policy failure; it is a moral failure. Now, I know the President will say that he inherited an economic crisis. But we shouldn't allow the challenges he faced four years ago to divert our attention from another important fact: The President pursued policies that have made this the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. And he broke promises many were counting on to build a brighter future. It did not have to be this way. Just compare this President's record with Ronald Reagan's first term. President Reagan also faced an economic crisis. In fact, in 1982, the unemployment rate peaked at nearly 11 percent. But in the two years that followed, he delivered a true recovery – economic growth and job creation were three times higher than in the Obama Economy. If President Obama had delivered a real recovery – a Reagan recovery – we would have five million more jobs today. The unemployment rate would be about six percent. And our economy would be at least one trillion dollars larger. Tomorrow, President Obama will speak here, for the first time since his last campaign. He may admit that he hasn't kept every promise. And he'll probably say that, even though you aren't better off today than you were four years ago, things could be worse. He'll imply that you really don't have an alternative. He's taking your vote for granted. I've come here today with a simple message: You do have an alternative. Your vote should be respected. And your voice is more important now than ever before. This November, we'll make a choice. We can continue along the path we're on – or we can choose a better way. Instead of continuing with the policies of the last three and a half years, we can revitalize our free-enterprise economy. We can lead the world in what we invent and build and create. And let me make this very clear—this is the only way we can strengthen the middle class. And this is the only way we can create sustained prosperity. Raising taxes to grow government does not grow the middle class. Today, I am asking you to join me because, while we may not agree on everything, we share the same goal, the same vision, and the same belief in American greatness that draws so many to our shores. Liberty's torch can burn just as brightly for future generations of immigrants as it has burned for immigrants past. We know our businesses can't succeed, grow, and hire more workers without a more competitive tax code. That's why I will lower our corporate tax rate, and reduce individual marginal rates by 20 percent, across the board. We also know that our businesses and families need affordable and reliable energy. Producing more of our energy resources will create jobs in America and generate greater revenues for America. It will also help bring manufacturing back to our shores. We know our economy can't grow if we're mortgaging our future to pay for the big government programs of today. As President, I will rein in spending and balance the budget. And I will repeal Obamacare. We cannot afford another $2 trillion entitlement. Obamacare depresses job growth. In one study, 73 percent of business owners said that Obamacare has made it harder for them to hire people. Repealing Obamacare and replacing it will give businesses the certainty they need to hire, expand, and grow. We can also jumpstart our economy by expanding trade in our hemisphere. Yet, the President has not completed a single new trade agreement with Latin America. And he's failed to crack down on countries like China that don't follow the rules. We know our kids can't succeed if they're trapped in failing schools. That's why, as President, I will give the parents of every low-income and special-needs student the chance to choose where their child goes to school. When it comes to education, a choice for every parent means a chance for every child. An effective immigration system can also strengthen our economy, as it has since the nation's founding. Unfortunately, despite his promises, President Obama has failed to address immigration reform. For two years, this President had huge majorities in the House and Senate – he was free to pursue any policy he pleased. But he did nothing to advance a permanent fix for our broken immigration system. Instead, he failed to act until facing a tough re-election and trying to secure your vote. Last week, the President finally offered a temporary measure that he seems to think will be just enough to get him through the election. After three and a half years of putting every issue from loan guarantees for his donors to Cash For Clunkers before immigration, now the President has been seized by an overwhelming need to do what he could have done on Day One. I think you deserve better. Some people have asked if I will let stand the President's executive action. The answer is that I will put in place my own long-term solution that will replace and supersede the President's temporary measure. As President, I won't settle for a stop-gap measure. I will work with Republicans and Democrats to find a long-term solution. I will prioritize measures that strengthen legal immigration and make it easier. And I will address the problem of illegal immigration in a civil but resolute manner. We may not always agree, but when I make a promise to you, I will keep it. Let me speak to a few principles that will guide me. As I have said many times, it is critical that we redouble our efforts to secure the borders. That means both preventing illegal border crossings and making it harder to illegally overstay a visa. We should field enough border patrol agents, complete a high-tech fence, and implement an improved exit verification system. Our immigration system should help promote strong families, not keep them apart. Our nation benefits when moms and dads and their kids are all living together under the same roof. But, today, too many families are caught in a broken system that costs them time and money and entangles them in red tape. For those seeking to come to America the right way, that kind of bureaucratic nightmare has to end. And we can do this with just a few common-sense reforms. As President, I will reallocate Green Cards to those seeking to keep their families under one roof. We will exempt from caps the spouses and minor children of legal permanent residents. And we will eliminate other forms of bureaucratic red tape that keep families from being together. Immigration reform is not just a moral imperative, but an economic necessity as well. Immigrants with advanced degrees start companies, create jobs, and drive innovation at a high rate. Immigrants founded or cofounded nearly half of our 50 top venture-backed companies. They are nearly 30 percent more likely to start a business. And that kind of risk taking is something we need more than ever because new business starts are now at a 30-year low. I will work with states and employers to update our temporary worker visa program so that it meets our economic needs. And if you get an advanced degree here, we want you to stay here – so we will staple a green card to your diploma. We want the best and brightest to enrich the nation through the jobs and technologies they will help create. We also have a strong tradition in this country of honoring immigrants who join our military and put their lives on the line to keep this country safe. Since September 11, 2001, the United States has naturalized almost 75,000 members of the Armed Forces. Too many of these patriots died on distant battlefields for our freedom before receiving full citizenship here in the country they called ""home."" As President, I will stand for a path to legal status for anyone who is willing to stand up and defend this great nation through military service. Those who have risked their lives in defense of America have earned the right to make their life in America. But improving access to legal immigration is only one part of the equation. We must also make legal immigration more attractive than illegal immigration, so that people are rewarded for waiting patiently in line. That's why my administration will establish a strong employment verification system so that every business can know with confidence that the people it hires are legally eligible for employment. We can find common ground here, and we must. We owe it to ourselves as Americans to ensure that our country remains a land of opportunity – both for those who were born here and for those who share our values, respect our laws, and want to come to our shores. I've spoken often about how proud I am of my father. He was born to American parents living in Mexico. When he was five, they left everything behind, and started over in the United States. His dad – my grandfather – was a builder who went bust more than once. My grandfather didn't make much money. There were times in my dad's life when he lived in poverty. But my grandfather had big hopes for my dad, and tried to help him as best he could. My Dad didn't finish college. But he believed in a country where the circumstances of one's birth were not a barrier to achievement – and he wasn't afraid of hard work. He held odd jobs – lath and plaster and selling paint. He was lucky enough to live in America, where hard work can turn aspirations into realities. And he became the leader of a great car company and the governor of a great state. This is my father's story – but it could be any American's. Most of you here today are leaders in your community. You are here because you have benefitted from this land of opportunity, and you want to give back to this country, to fight for its people, so that they have the same chance to succeed. We are truly one America. Everyone here has made this exceptional nation what it is today. This isn't an election about two people. This isn't an election about being a Republican, Democrat, or an independent. This is an election about the future of America. I would ask each of you to look at the last three and a half years, and ask whether we can do better. Is the America of 11% Hispanic unemployment the America of our dreams? I know we can do better. We can prosper again, with the powerful recovery we have all been waiting for, the good jobs that so many still need, and, above all, the opportunities we owe to our children and grandchildren. Thank you all, and God bless America.  "
Mitt Romney,7/11/2012,"NAACP Convention in Houston, Texas",South,"Mitt Romney, Remarks at the NAACP Convention in Houston, Texas Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/301531","Thank you, Bishop Graves, for your generous introduction. Thanks also to President Ben Jealous and Chairman Roslyn Brock for the opportunity to be here this morning, and for your hospitality.  It is an honor to address you. I appreciate the chance to speak first — even before Vice President Biden gets his turn tomorrow.  I just hope the Obama campaign won't think you're playing favorites. You all know something of my background, and maybe you've wondered how any Republican ever becomes governor of Massachusetts in the first place.  Well, in a state with 11 percent Republican registration, you don't get there by just talking to Republicans.  We have to make our case to every voter.  We don't count anybody out, and we sure don't make a habit of presuming anyone's support. Support is asked for and earned — and that's why I'm here today.   With 90 percent of African-Americans voting for Democrats, some of you may wonder why a Republican would bother to campaign in the African American community, and to address the NAACP.  Of course, one reason is that I hope to represent all Americans, of every race, creed or sexual orientation, from the poorest to the richest and everyone in between. But there is another reason: I believe that if you understood who I truly am in my heart, and if it were possible to fully communicate what I believe is in the real, enduring best interest of African American families, you would vote for me for president. I want you to know that if I did not believe that my policies and my leadership would help families of color -- and families of any color -- more than the policies and leadership of President Obama, I would not be running for president. The opposition charges that I and people in my party are running for office to help the rich.  Nonsense.  The rich will do just fine whether I am elected or not. The President wants to make this a campaign about blaming the rich. I want to make this a campaign about helping the middle class.  I am running for president because I know that my policies and vision will help hundreds of millions of middle class Americans of all races, will lift people from poverty, and will help prevent people from becoming poor. My campaign is about helping the people who need help. The course the President has set has not done that — and will not do that. My course will. When President Obama called to congratulate me on becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, he said that he, ""looked forward to an important and healthy debate about America's future.""  To date, I'm afraid that his campaign has taken a different course than that. But, in campaigns at their best, voters can expect a clear choice, and candidates can expect a fair hearing — only more so from a venerable organization like this one. So, it is that healthy debate about the course of the nation that I want to discuss with you today. If someone had told us in the 1950s or 1960s that a black citizen would serve as the forty-fourth president, we would have been proud and many would have been surprised.  Picturing that day, we might have assumed that the American presidency would be the very last door of opportunity to be opened.  Before that came to pass, every other barrier on the path to equal opportunity would surely have come down.   Of course, it hasn't happened quite that way.  Many barriers remain.  Old inequities persist.  In some ways, the challenges are even more complicated than before.  And across America -- and even within your own ranks -- there are serious, honest debates about the way forward.   If equal opportunity in America were an accomplished fact, then a chronically bad economy would be equally bad for everyone.  Instead, it's worse for African Americans in almost every way.  The unemployment rate, the duration of unemployment, average income, and median family wealth are all worse for the black community. In June, while the overall unemployment rate remained stuck at 8.2 percent, the unemployment rate for African Americans actually went up, from 13.6 percent to 14.4 percent. Americans of every background are asking when this economy will finally recover — and you, in particular, are entitled to an answer.   If equal opportunity in America were an accomplished fact, black families could send their sons and daughters to public schools that truly offer the hope of a better life.  Instead, for generations, the African-American community has been waiting and waiting for that promise to be kept.  Today, black children are 17 percent of students nationwide — but they are 42 percent of the students in our worst-performing schools. Our society sends them into mediocre schools and expects them to perform with excellence, and that is not fair.  Frederick Douglass observed that, ""It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.""  Yet, instead of preparing these children for life, too many schools set them up for failure. Everyone in this room knows that we owe them better than that. The path of inequality often leads to lost opportunity. College, graduate school, and first jobs should be milestones marking the passage from childhood to adulthood. But for too many disadvantaged young people, these goals seem unattainable — and their lives take a tragic turn.  Many live in neighborhoods filled with violence and fear, and empty of opportunity. Their impatience for real change is understandable. They are entitled to feel that life in America should be better than this. They are told even now to wait for improvements in our economy and in our schools, but it seems to me that these Americans have waited long enough. The point is that when decades of the same promises keep producing the same failures, then it's reasonable to rethink our approach — and consider a new plan.   I'm hopeful that together we can set a new direction in federal policy, starting where many of our problems do — with the family. A study from the Brookings Institution has shown that for those who graduate from high school, get a full-time job, and wait until 21 before they marry and then have their first child, the probability of being poor is two percent.  And if those factors are absent, the probability of being poor is 76 percent. Here at the NAACP, you understand the deep and lasting difference the family makes. Your former executive director, Dr. Benjamin Hooks, had it exactly right.  The family, he said, ""remains the bulwark and the mainstay of the black community.  That great truth must not be overlooked."" Any policy that lifts up and honors the family is going to be good for the country, and that must be our goal. As President, I will promote strong families — and I will defend traditional marriage. As you may have heard from my opponent, I am also a believer in the free-enterprise system. I believe it can bring change where so many well-meaning government programs have failed.  I've never heard anyone look around an impoverished neighborhood and say, ""You know, there's too much free enterprise around here.  Too many shops, too many jobs, too many people putting money in the bank."" What you hear, of course, is how do we bring in jobs?  How do we make good, honest employers want to move in and stay?  And with the shape this economy is in, we're asking that more than ever.   Free enterprise is still the greatest force for upward mobility, economic security, and the expansion of the middle class.  We have seen in recent years what it's like to have less free enterprise. As President, I will show the good things that can happen when we have more — more business activity, more jobs, more opportunity, more paychecks, more savings accounts.   On Day One, I will begin turning this economy around with a plan for the middle class.  And I don't mean just those who are middle class now — I also mean those who have waited so long for their chance to join the middle class. I know what it will take to put people back to work, to bring more jobs and better wages. My jobs plan is based on 25 years of success in business. It has five key steps. First, I will take full advantage of our energy resources, and I will approve the Keystone pipeline from Canada. Low cost, plentiful coal, natural gas, oil, and renewables will bring over a million manufacturing jobs back to the United States. Second, I will open up new markets for American products. We are the most productive major economy in the world, so trade means good jobs for Americans. But trade must be free and fair, so I'll clamp down on cheaters like China and make sure that they finally play by the rules. Third, I will reduce government spending. Our high level of debt slows GDP growth and that means fewer jobs. If our goal is jobs, we must, must stop spending over a trillion dollars more than we earn. To do this, I will eliminate expensive non-essential programs like Obamacare, and I will work to reform and save Medicare and Social Security, in part by means-testing their benefits.  Fourth, I will focus on nurturing and developing the skilled workers our economy so desperately needs and the future demands. This is the human capital with which tomorrow's bright future will be built. Too many homes and too many schools are failing to provide our children with the skills and education that are essential for anything other than a minimum-wage job. And finally and perhaps most importantly, I will restore economic freedom. This nation's economy runs on freedom, on opportunity, on entrepreneurs, on dreamers who innovate and build businesses. These entrepreneurs are being crushed by high taxation, burdensome regulation, hostile regulators, excessive healthcare costs, and destructive labor policies. I will work to make America the best place in the world for innovators and entrepreneurs and businesses small and large.  Do these five things — open up energy, expand trade, cut the growth of government, focus on better educating tomorrow's workers today, and restore economic freedom — and jobs will come back to America, and wages will rise again. The President will say he will do those things, but he will not, he cannot, and his record of the last four years proves it. If I am president, job one for me will be creating jobs. I have no hidden agenda. If you want a president who will make things better in the African American community, you are looking at him.  Finally, I will address the institutionalized inequality in our education system.  And I know something about this from my time as governor.   In the years before I took office our state's leaders had come together to pass bipartisan measures that were making a difference.  In reading and in math, our students were already among the best in the nation — and during my term, they took over the top spot.   Those results revealed what good teachers can do if the system will only let them.  The problem was, this success wasn't shared.  A significant achievement gap between students of different races remained.  So we set out to close it. I urged faster interventions in failing schools, and the funding to go along with it.  I promoted math and science excellence in schools, and proposed paying bonuses to our best teachers. I refused to weaken testing standards, and instead raised them. To graduate from high school, students had to pass an exam in math and English — I added a science requirement as well. And I put in place a merit scholarship for those students who excelled: the top 25 percent of students in each high school were awarded a John and Abigail Adams Scholarship — which meant four years tuition-free at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning.  When I was governor, not only did test scores improve — we also narrowed the achievement gap. The teachers unions were not happy with a number of these reforms. They especially did not like our emphasis on choice through charter schools, particularly for our inner city kids. Accordingly, the legislature passed a moratorium on any new charter schools. As you know, in Boston, in Harlem, in Los Angeles, and all across the country, charter schools are giving children a chance, children that otherwise could be locked in failing schools. I was inspired just a few weeks ago by the students in one of Kenny Gamble's charter schools in Philadelphia.  Right here in Houston is another success story:  the Knowledge Is Power Program, which has set the standard, thanks to the groundbreaking work of the late Harriet Ball.  These charter schools are doing a lot more than closing the achievement gap.  They are bringing hope and opportunity to places where for years there has been none.   Charter schools are so successful that almost every politician can find something good to say about them.  But, as we saw in Massachusetts, true reform requires more than talk. As Governor, I vetoed the bill blocking charter schools. But our legislature was 87 percent Democrat, and my veto could have been easily over-ridden. So I joined with the Black Legislative Caucus, and their votes helped preserve my veto, which meant that new charter schools, including some in urban neighborhoods, would be opened.  When it comes to education reform, candidates cannot have it both ways — talking up education reform, while indulging the same groups that are blocking reform.  You can be the voice of disadvantaged public-school students, or you can be the protector of special interests like the teachers unions, but you can't be both.  I have made my choice: As president, I will be a champion of real education reform in America, and I won't let any special interest get in the way.   I will give the parents of every low-income and special needs student the chance to choose where their child goes to school.  For the first time in history, federal education funds will be linked to a student, so that parents can send their child to any public or charter school, or to a private school, where permitted.  And I will make that a true choice by ensuring there are good options available to all.    Should I be elected President, I'll lead as I did when I was governor. I am pleased today to be joined today by Reverend Jeffrey Brown, who was a member of my kitchen cabinet in Massachusetts that helped guide my policy and actions that affected the African American community. I will look for support wherever there is good will and shared conviction. I will work with you to help our children attend better schools and help our economy create good jobs with better wages. I can't promise that you and I will agree on every issue.  But I do promise that your hospitality to me today will be returned.  We will know one another, and work to common purposes.  I will seek your counsel.  And if I am elected president, and you invite me to next year's convention, I would count it as a privilege, and my answer will be yes.   The Republican Party's record, by the measures you rightly apply, is not perfect.  Any party that claims a perfect record doesn't know history the way you know it. Yet always, in both parties, there have been men and women of integrity, decency, and humility who called injustice by its name.  For every one of us a particular person comes to mind, someone who set a standard of conduct and made us better by their example.  For me, that man is my father, George Romney. It wasn't just that my Dad helped write the civil rights provision for the Michigan Constitution, though he did.  It wasn't just that he helped create Michigan's first civil rights commission, or that as governor he marched for civil rights in Detroit — though he did those things, too.   More than these public acts, it was the kind of man he was, and the way he dealt with every person, black or white.  He was a man of the fairest instincts, and a man of faith who knew that every person was a child of God. I'm grateful to him for so many things, and above all for the knowledge of God, whose ways are not always our ways, but whose justice is certain and whose mercy endures forever.   Every good cause on this earth relies in the end on a plan bigger than ours.  ""Without dependence on God,"" as Dr. King said, ""our efforts turn to ashes and our sunrises into darkest night.  Unless his spirit pervades our lives, we find only what G. K. Chesterton called 'cures that don't cure, blessings that don't bless, and solutions that don't solve.'"" Of all that you bring to the work of today's civil rights cause, no advantage counts for more than this abiding confidence in the name above every name. Against cruelty, arrogance, and all the foolishness of man, this spirit has carried the NAACP to many victories.  More still are up ahead, and with each one we will be a better nation.   Thank you, and God bless you all.

Mitt Romney,7/24/2012,"Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention in Reno, Nevada",West,"Mitt Romney, Remarks at the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention in Reno, Nevada Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/301934","Thank you. Commander Richard DeNoyer, I appreciate the introduction, and I'm proud to see a combat veteran from Massachusetts serving as National Commander of the VFW... Ladies Auxiliary President Gwen Rankin, incoming National Commander John Hamilton, incoming Ladies Auxiliary President Leanne Lemley, Adjutant General Allen ""Gunner"" Kent, Executive Director Bob Wallace, distinguished guests and members of the VFW: Thank you for your generous welcome. I want to start today with a few words about the unimaginable tragedy in Colorado last week. We've since learned that among the victims were four people who had served — or were serving — our country in uniform. Today, our hearts go out to the families of John Larimer of the U.S. Navy; Rebecca Wingo, an Air Force veteran; Jesse Childress, an Army veteran and member of the Air Force reserve; and Jonathan Blunk, a Navy veteran who died shielding his girlfriend from the spray of bullets. The loss of four Americans who served our country only adds to the profound tragedy of that day. All Americans are grateful for their service and deeply saddened by their deaths. We mourn them and we will remember them. The VFW is now over two million strong. It has a special place in America's heart. Some of you fought recently, in Iraq or Afghanistan. Others are old enough to have marched, flown, or sailed by orders of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Whatever your age, whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, whenever you served — there's one thing you have in common: You answered the call of your country in a time of war. From December 7th, 1941 to September 11, 2001, whenever America has been tested, you stepped forward. You come from our farms, our great cities, our small towns and quiet neighborhoods. Many of you have known violence so that your neighbors could only know peace. You have done more than protect America; your courage and service defines America. You are America at our best and it is an honor to address you. Our veterans are part of a proud tradition that stretches back to the battlefields at Lexington and Concord — and now to places like Fallujah and Kandahar. Year after year, our men and women in uniform have added proud achievements to their record of service. And President Obama pointed to some of them yesterday in his speech. Any time our military accomplishes a vital mission it is a proud moment for our nation. But we owe our veterans and our military more than just an accounting of our successes. They deserve a fair and frank assessment of the whole picture — of where we are and where we want to be. And when it comes to national security and foreign policy, as with our economy, the last few years have been a time of declining influence and missed opportunity. Just consider some of the challenges I discussed at your last national convention: Since then, has the American economy recovered? Has our ability to shape world events been enhanced, or diminished? Have we gained greater confidence among our allies, and greater respect from our adversaries? And, perhaps most importantly, has the most severe security threat facing America and our friends, a nuclear-armed Iran, become more or less likely? These clear measures are the ultimate tests of American leadership. And, by these standards, we haven't seen much in the President's first term that inspires confidence in a second. The President's policies have made it harder to recover from the deepest recession in seventy years ... exposed the military to cuts that no one can justify ... compromised our national-security secrets ... and in dealings with other nations, given trust where it is not earned, insult where it is not deserved, and apology where it is not due. From Berlin to Cairo to the United Nations, President Obama has shared his view of America and its place among nations. I have come here today to share mine. I am an unapologetic believer in the greatness of this country. I am not ashamed of American power. I take pride that throughout history our power has brought justice where there was tyranny, peace where there was conflict, and hope where there was affliction and despair. I do not view America as just one more point on the strategic map, one more power to be balanced. I believe our country is the greatest force for good the world has ever known, and that our influence is needed as much now as ever. And I am guided by one overwhelming conviction and passion: This century must be an American Century. In 1941, Henry Luce called on his countrymen — just then realizing their strength — ""to create the first great American century."" And they succeeded: together with their allies, they won World War II, they rescued Europe, they defeated Communism, and America took its place as leader of the free world. Across the globe, they fought, they bled, they led. They showed the world the extraordinary courage of the American heart and the generosity of the American spirit. That courage and generosity remains unchanged today. But sadly, this president has diminished American leadership, and we are reaping the consequences. The world is dangerous, destructive, chaotic. And the two men running to be your commander-in-chief must offer their answers to the challenges we face. Like a watchman in the night, we must remain at our post — and keep guard of the freedom that defines and ennobles us, and our friends. In an American Century, we have the strongest economy and the strongest military in the world. In an American Century, we secure peace through our strength. And if by absolute necessity we must employ it, we must wield our strength with resolve. In an American Century, we lead the free world and the free world leads the entire world. If we do not have the strength or vision to lead, then other powers will take our place, pulling history in a very different direction. A just and peaceful world depends on a strong and confident America. I pledge to you that if I become commander-in-chief, the United States of America will fulfill its duty, and its destiny. American leadership depends, as it always has, on our economic strength, on our military strength, and on our moral strength. If any of these falter, no skill of diplomacy or presidential oratory can compensate. Today, the strength of our economy is in jeopardy. A healthy American economy is what underwrites American power. When growth is missing, government revenue falls, social spending rises, and many in Washington look to cut defense spending as an easy out. That includes our current President. Today, we are just months away from an arbitrary, across-the-board budget reduction that would saddle the military with a trillion dollars in cuts, severely shrink our force structure, and impair our ability to meet and deter threats. Don't bother trying to find a serious military rationale behind any of this, unless that rationale is wishful thinking. Strategy is not driving President Obama's massive defense cuts. In fact, his own Secretary of Defense warned that these reductions would be ""devastating."" And he is right. That devastation starts at home. These cuts would only weaken an already stretched VA system and impair our solemn commitment that every veteran receives care second to none. I will not allow that to happen. This is not the time for the President's radical cuts in the military. Look around the globe. Other major powers are rapidly adding to their military capabilities, some with intentions very different from ours. The regime in Tehran is drawing closer to developing a nuclear weapon. The threat of radical Islamic terrorism persists. The threat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation is ever-present. And we are still at war and still have uniformed men and women in conflict. All this and more is ongoing in the world. And yet the President has chosen this moment for wholesale reductions in the nation's military capacity. When the biggest announcement in his last State of the Union address on improving our military was that the Pentagon will start using more clean energy — then you know it's time for a change. We're not the first people to observe this. It is reported that Bob Gates, the President's first secretary of defense, bluntly addressed another security problem within this administration. After secret operational details of the bin Laden raid were given to reporters, Secretary Gates walked into the West Wing and told the Obama team to ""shut up."" He added a colorful word for emphasis. Lives of American servicemen and women are at stake. But astonishingly, the administration failed to change its ways. More top-secret operations were leaked, even some involving covert action in Iran. This isn't a partisan issue; it's a national security crisis. And yesterday, Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, quote, ""I think the White House has to understand that some of this is coming from their ranks."" This conduct is contemptible. It betrays our national interest. It compromises our men and women in the field. And it demands a full and prompt investigation by a special counsel, with explanation and consequence. Obama appointees, who are accountable to President Obama's Attorney General, should not be responsible for investigating the leaks coming from the Obama White House. Whoever provided classified information to the media, seeking political advantage for the administration, must be exposed, dismissed, and punished. The time for stonewalling is over. It is not enough to say the matter is being looked into, and leave it at that. When the issue is the political use of highly sensitive national security information, it is unacceptable to say, ""We'll report our findings after Election Day."" Exactly who in the White House betrayed these secrets? Did a superior authorize it? These are things that Americans are entitled to know — and they are entitled to know right now. If the President believes — as he said last week — that the buck stops with him, then he owes all Americans a full and prompt accounting of the facts. And let me make this very clear: These events make the decision we face in November all the more important. What kind of White House would reveal classified material for political gain? I'll tell you right now: Mine won't. The harm done when national security secrets are betrayed extends, of course, to the trust that allies place in the United States. The operating principle of American foreign policy has been to work with our allies so that we can deter aggression before it breaks out into open conflict. That policy depends on nurturing our alliances and standing up for our common values. Yet the President has moved in the opposite direction. It began with the sudden abandonment of friends in Poland and the Czech Republic. They had courageously agreed to provide sites for our anti-missile systems, only to be told, at the last hour, that the agreement was off. As part of the so-called reset in policy, missile defenses were sacrificed as a unilateral concession to the Russian government. If that gesture was designed to inspire good will from Russia, it clearly missed the mark. The Russian government defended the dictator in Damascus, arming him as he slaughtered the Syrian people. We can only guess what Vladimir Putin makes of the Obama administration. He regained the Russian presidency in a corrupt election, and for that, he got a congratulatory call from the Oval Office. And then there was that exchange picked up by a microphone that President Obama didn't know was on. We heard him asking Dmitry Medvedev to tell Mr. Putin to give him ""space."" ""This is my last election,"" President Obama said, and ""After my election I'll have more flexibility."" Why is flexibility with Russian leaders more important than transparency to the American people? President Obama had a moment of candor, however, just the other day. He said that the actions of the Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez have not had a serious national security impact on us. In my view, inviting Hezbollah into our hemisphere is severe, serious, and a threat. But at least he was consistent. After all, this is the president who faltered when the Iranian people were looking for support in their struggle against the ayatollahs. That uprising was treated as an inconvenient problem for the President's policy of engagement, instead of as a moral and strategic opportunity. That terrible misjudgment should never be repeated. When unarmed women and men in Tehran find the courage to confront their oppressors, at risk of torture and death, they should hear the unequivocal voice of an American president affirming their right to be free. I will leave Reno this evening on a trip abroad that will take me to England, Poland, and Israel. And since I wouldn't venture into another country to question American foreign policy, I will tell you right here — before I leave — what I think of this administration's shabby treatment of one of our finest friends. President Obama is fond of lecturing Israel's leaders. He was even caught by a microphone deriding them. He has undermined their position, which was tough enough as it was. And even at the United Nations, to the enthusiastic applause of Israel's enemies, he spoke as if our closest ally in the Middle East was the problem. The people of Israel deserve better than what they have received from the leader of the free world. And the chorus of accusations, threats, and insults at the United Nations should never again include the voice of the President of the United States. There are values, causes, and nations that depend on American strength, on the clarity of our purpose, and on the reliability of our commitments. There is work in this world that only America and our allies can do, hostile powers that only we can deter, and challenges that only we can overcome. For the past decade, among those challenges has been the war in Afghanistan. As commander-in-chief, I will have a solemn duty to our men and women in uniform. A president owes our troops, their families, and the American people a clear explanation of our mission, and a commitment not to play politics with the decisions of war. I have been critical of the President's decision to withdraw the surge troops during the fighting season, against the advice of the commanders on the ground. President Obama would have you believe that anyone who disagrees with his decisions is arguing for endless war. But the route to more war — and to potential attacks here at home — is a politically timed retreat. As president, my goal in Afghanistan will be to complete a successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014. I will evaluate conditions on the ground and solicit the best advice of our military commanders. And I will affirm that my duty is not to my political prospects, but to the security of the nation. We face another continuing challenge in a rising China. China is attentive to the interests of its government — but it too often disregards the rights of its people. It is selective in the freedoms it allows; and, as with its one-child policy, it can be ruthless in crushing the freedoms it denies. In conducting trade with America, it permits flagrant patent and copyright violations ... forestalls American businesses from competing in its market ... and manipulates its currency to obtain unfair advantage. It is in our mutual interest for China to be a partner for a stable and secure world, and we welcome its participation in trade. But the cheating must finally be brought to a stop. President Obama hasn't done it and won't do it. I will. We'll need that same clarity of purpose and resolve in the Middle East. America cannot be neutral in the outcome there. We must clearly stand for the values of representative government, economic opportunity, and human rights. And we must stand against the extension of Iranian or jihadist influence. Egypt is at the center of this historical drama. In many ways, it has the power to tip the balance in the Arab world toward freedom and modernity. As president, I will not only direct the billions in assistance we give to Egypt toward that goal, but I will also work with partner nations to place conditions on their assistance as well. Unifying our collective influence behind a common purpose will foster the development of a government that represents all Egyptians, maintains peace with Israel, and promotes peace throughout the region. The United States is willing to help Egypt support peace and prosperity, but we will not be complicit in oppression and instability. There is no greater danger in the world today than the prospect of the ayatollahs in Tehran possessing nuclear weapons capability. Yet for all the talks and conferences, all of the extensions and assurances, can anyone say we are farther from this danger now than four years ago? The same ayatollahs who each year mark a holiday by leading chants of ""Death to America"" are not going to be talked out of their pursuit of nuclear weapons. What's needed is all the firmness, clarity, and moral courage that we and our allies can gather. Sanctions must be enforced without exception, cutting off the regime's sources of wealth. Negotiations must secure full and unhindered access for inspections. As it is, the Iranian regime claims the right to enrich nuclear material for supposedly peaceful purposes. This claim is discredited by years of deception. A clear line must be drawn: There must be a full suspension of any enrichment, period. And at every turn, Iran must know that the United States and our allies stand as one in these critical objectives. Only in this way can we successfully counter the catastrophic threat that Iran presents. I pledge to you and to all Americans that if I become commander-in-chief, I will use every means necessary to protect ourselves and the region, and to prevent the worst from happening while there is still time. It is a mistake — and sometimes a tragic one — to think that firmness in American foreign policy can bring only tension or conflict. The surest path to danger is always weakness and indecision. In the end, it is resolve that moves events in our direction, and strength that keeps the peace. I will not surrender America's leadership in the world. We must have confidence in our cause, clarity in our purpose, and resolve in our might. This is very simple: if you do not want America to be the strongest nation on earth, I am not your President. You have that President today. The 21st century can and must be an American Century. It began with terror, war, and economic calamity. It is our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom, peace, and prosperity. Fewer members of the Greatest Generation are with us today — and they can't hold the torch as high as they have in the past. We must now seize the torch they carried so gallantly and at such sacrifice. It is an eternal torch of decency, freedom and hope. It is not America's torch alone. But it is America's duty — and honor — to hold it high enough so that all the world can see its light. Believe in America. Thank you and God Bless the United States of America.  "
Mitt Romney,7/29/2012,"Jerusalem Foundation in Jerusalem, Israel",Abroad,"Mitt Romney, Remarks to the Jerusalem Foundation in Jerusalem, Israel Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/302125","Thank you for that kind introduction, Mayor Barkat, and thank you all for that warm welcome.  It's a pleasure and a privilege to be in Israel again.   To step foot into Israel is to step foot into a nation that began with an ancient promise made in this land. The Jewish people persisted through one of the most monstrous crimes in human history, and now this nation has come to take its place among the most impressive democracies on earth. Israel's achievements are a wonder of the modern world.  These achievements are a tribute to the resilience of the Israeli people.  You have managed, against all odds, time and again throughout your history, to persevere, to rise up, and to emerge stronger. The historian Paul Johnson, writing on the 50th anniversary of the creation of the Jewish state, said that over the course of Israel's life, 100 completely new independent states had come into existence. ""Israel is the only one whose creation can fairly be called a miracle,"" Johnson wrote. It is a deeply moving experience to be in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel. Our two nations are separated by more than 5,000 miles. But for an American abroad, you can't get much closer to the ideals and convictions of my own country than you do in Israel.  We're part of the great fellowship of democracies.  We speak the same language of freedom and justice, and the right of every person to live in peace.  We serve the same cause and provoke the same hatreds in the same enemies of civilization. It is my firm conviction that the security of Israel is in the vital national security interest of the United States. And ours is an alliance based not only on shared interests but also on enduring shared values. In those shared values, one of the strongest voices is that of your prime minister, my friend Benjamin Netanyahu.  I met with him earlier this morning and I look forward to my family joining his this evening as they observe the close of this fast day of Tisha B'Av. It's remarkable to consider how much adversity, over so great a span of time, is recalled by just one day on the calendar.  This is a day of remembrance and mourning, but like other such occasions, it also calls forth clarity and resolve. At this time, we also remember the 11 Israeli athletes and coaches who were massacred at the Munich Olympics forty years ago. Ten years ago this week, 9 Israeli and American students were murdered in the terrorist attack at Hebrew University. And tragedies like these are not reserved to the past. They are a constant reminder of the reality of hate, and the will with which it is executed upon the innocent. It was Menachem Begin who said this about the Ninth of the month of Av:  ""We remember that day,"" he said, ""and now have the responsibility to make sure that never again will our independence be destroyed and never again will the Jew become homeless or defenseless."" ""This,"" Prime Minister Begin added, ""is the crux of the problems facing us in the future."" So it is today, as Israel faces enemies who deny past crimes against the Jewish people and seek to commit new ones.  When Iran's leaders deny the Holocaust or speak of wiping this nation off the map, only the naïve — or worse — will dismiss it as an excess of rhetoric.  Make no mistake: the ayatollahs in Tehran are testing our moral defenses.  They want to know who will object, and who will look the other way. My message to the people of Israel and the leaders of Iran is one and the same: I will not look away; and neither will my country. As Prime Minister Begin put it, in vivid and haunting words, ""if an enemy of [the Jewish] people says he seeks to destroy us, believe him."" We have seen the horrors of history.  We will not stand by.  We will not watch them play out again. It would be foolish not to take Iran's leaders at their word. They are, after all, the product of a radical theocracy.  Over the years Iran has amassed a bloody and brutal record. It has seized embassies, targeted diplomats, and killed its own people. It supports the ruthless Assad regime in Syria. They have provided weapons that have killed American soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq. It has plotted to assassinate diplomats on American soil.  It is Iran that is the leading state sponsor of terrorism and the most destabilizing nation in the world. We have a solemn duty and a moral imperative to deny Iran's leaders the means to follow through on their malevolent intentions. We should stand with all who would join our effort to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran — and that includes Iranian dissidents. Do not erase from your memory the scenes from three years ago, when that regime brought death to its own people as they rose up. The threat we face does not come from the Iranian people, but from the regime that oppresses them. Five years ago, at the Herzliya Conference, I stated my view that Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability presents an intolerable threat to Israel, to America, and to the world. That threat has only become worse.   Now as then, the regime's claims that it seeks to enrich nuclear material for peaceful purposes are belied by years of malign deceptions. Now as then, the conduct of Iran's leaders gives us no reason to trust them with nuclear material. But today, the regime in Iran is five years closer to developing nuclear weapons capability.  Preventing that outcome must be our highest national security priority. I want to pause on this last point. It is sometimes said that those who are the most committed to stopping the Iranian regime from securing nuclear weapons are reckless and provocative and inviting war. The opposite is true. We are the true peacemakers. History teaches with force and clarity that when the world's most despotic regimes secure the world's most destructive weapons, peace often gives way to oppression, to violence, or to devastating war. We must not delude ourselves into thinking that containment is an option. We must lead the effort to prevent Iran from building and possessing nuclear weapons capability. We should employ any and all measures to dissuade the Iranian regime from its nuclear course, and it is our fervent hope that diplomatic and economic measures will do so. In the final analysis, of course, no option should be excluded. We recognize Israel's right to defend itself, and that it is right for America to stand with you. These are some of the principles I first outlined five years ago. What was timely then has become urgent today. Let me turn from Iran to other nations in the Middle East, where we have seen rising tumult and chaos. To the north, Syria is on the brink of a civil war.  The dictator in Damascus, no friend to Israel and no friend to America, slaughters his own people as he desperately clings to power. Your other neighbor to the north, Lebanon, is under the growing and dangerous influence of Hezbollah. After a year of upheaval and unrest, Egypt now has an Islamist President, chosen in a democratic election. Hopefully, this new government understands that one true measure of democracy is how those elected by the majority respect the rights of those in the minority.  The international community must use its considerable influence to ensure that the new government honors the peace agreement with Israel that was signed by the government of Anwar Sadat. As you know only too well, since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, thousands of rockets have rained on Israeli homes and cities.  I have walked on the streets of Sderot, and honor the resolve of its people. And now, new attacks have been launched from the Sinai Peninsula. With Hezbollah rockets aimed at Israel from the north, and Hamas rockets aimed from the south, with much of the Middle East in tumult, and with Iran bent on nuclear arms, America's vocal and demonstrated commitment to the defense of Israel is even more critical. Whenever the security of Israel is most in doubt, America's commitment to Israel must be most secure. When the decision was before him in 1948, President Harry Truman decided without hesitation that the United States would be the first country to recognize the State of Israel.  From that moment to this, we have been the most natural of allies, but our alliance runs deeper than the designs of strategy or the weighing of interests. The story of how America — a nation still so new to the world by the standards of this ancient region — rose up to become the dear friend of the people of Israel is among the finest and most hopeful in our nation's history.  Different as our paths have been, we see the same qualities in one another. Israel and America are in many respects reflections of one another. We both believe in democracy, in the right of every people to select their leaders and choose their nation's course. We both believe in the rule of law, knowing that in its absence, willful men may incline to oppress the weak.  We both believe that our rights are universal, granted not by government but by our Creator.  We both believe in free enterprise, because it is the only economic system that has lifted people from poverty, created a large and enduring middle class, and inaugurated incomparable achievements and human flourishing. As someone who has spent most of his life in business, I am particularly impressed with Israel's cutting edge technologies and thriving economy.  We recognize yours as the ""start-up nation"" — and the evidence is all around us.  You have embraced economic liberty.  You export technology, not tyranny or terrorism.  And today, your innovators and entrepreneurs have made the desert bloom and have made for a better world.  The citizens of our countries are fortunate to share in the rewards of economic freedom and in the creativity of our entrepreneurs. What you have built here, with your own hands, is a tribute to your people, and a model for others. Finally, we both believe in freedom of expression, because we are confident in our ideas and in the ability of men and women to think for themselves.  We do not fear open debate. If you want to hear some very sharp criticisms of Israel and its policies, you don't have to cross any borders.  All you have to do is walk down the street and into a café, where you'll hear people reasoning, arguing, and speaking their mind. Or pick up an Israeli newspaper — you'll find some of the toughest criticism of Israel you'll read anywhere. Your nation, like ours, is stronger for this energetic exchange of ideas and opinions. That is the way it is in a free society. There are many millions of people in the Middle East who would cherish the opportunity to do the same.  These decent men and women desire nothing more than to live in peace and freedom and to have the opportunity to not only choose their government but to criticize it openly, without fear of repression or repercussion. I believe that those who oppose these fundamental rights are on the wrong side of history. But history's march can be ponderous and painfully slow. We have a duty to speed and shape history by being unapologetic ambassadors for the values we share. The United States and Israel have shown that we can build strong economies and strong militaries. But we must also build strong arguments that advance our values and promote peace. We must work together to change hearts and awaken minds through the power of freedom, free enterprise and human rights. I believe that the enduring alliance between the State of Israel and the United States of America is more than a strategic alliance: it is a force for good in the world. America's support of Israel should make every American proud. We should not allow the inevitable complexities of modern geopolitics to obscure fundamental touchstones. No country or organization or individual should ever doubt this basic truth:  A free and strong America will always stand with a free and strong Israel. And standing by Israel does not mean with military and intelligence cooperation alone.  We cannot stand silent as those who seek to undermine Israel, voice their criticisms.  And we certainly should not join in that criticism. Diplomatic distance in public between our nations emboldens Israel's adversaries. By history and by conviction, our two countries are bound together.  No individual, no nation, no world organization, will pry us apart. And as long as we stay together and stand together, there is no threat we cannot overcome and very little that we cannot achieve. Thank you all.  May God bless America, and may He bless and protect the Nation of Israel.  "
Mitt Romney,7/31/2012,"Warsaw, Poland",Abroad,"Mitt Romney, Remarks in Warsaw, Poland: ""Freedom And Friendship"" Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/302455","Thank you all very much for the warm welcome to this great city. It has been a privilege to meet with President Komorowski, Prime Minister Tusk, Foreign Minister Sikorski, and Former President Walesa. This is a nation with an extraordinary heritage that is crafting a remarkable future. At a time of widespread economic slowdown and stagnation, your economy last year outperformed all other nations in Europe. I began this trip in Britain and end it here in Poland: the two bookends of NATO, history's greatest military alliance that has kept the peace for over half a century. While at 10 Downing Street I thought back to the days of Winston Churchill, the man who first spoke of the Iron Curtain that had descended across Europe. What an honor to stand in Poland, among the men and women who helped lift that curtain. After that stay in England, I visited the State of Israel - a friend of your country and mine. It's been a trip to three places far apart on the map. But for an American, you can't get much closer to the ideals and convictions of my own country. Our nations belong to the great fellowship of democracies. We speak the same language of freedom and justice. We uphold the right of every person to live in peace. I believe it is critical to stand by those who have stood by America. Solidarity was a great movement that freed a nation. And it is with solidarity that America and Poland face the future. Yesterday, I saw the memorial at Westerplatte and the gate at the Gdansk Shipyard, where Polish citizens stood with courage and determination against daunting odds. And today, on the eve of the 68th anniversary of this city's uprising against the Nazis, I will pay tribute at the monument to that historic struggle. Over 200,000 Poles were killed in those weeks, and this city was nearly destroyed. But your enduring spirit survived. Free men and women everywhere, whether they have been here or not, already know this about Poland: In some desperate hours of the last century, your people were the witnesses to hope, led onward by strength of heart and faith in God. Not only by force of arms, but by the power of truth, in villages and parishes across this land, you shamed the oppressor and gave light to the darkness. Time and again, history has recorded the ascent of liberty, propelled by souls that yearn for freedom and justice. Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has noted that it is often one brave man or woman who says ""no"" to oppression, and in doing so, sparks a revolution of courage in hundreds, thousands or millions of others. In 1955, in my country, Rosa Parks said ""no"" to a bus driver who told her to give up her seat to a white person, and in doing so, started a revolution of dignity and equality that continues to this day. Mohamed Bouazizi, a street vendor in Tunisia, was denied his business wares by a government functionary, and in protest committed suicide by self-immolation. With that act of defiance, the Arab Spring was born. Nicolai Ceausescu stood before an audience of 200,000, recounting for them his supposed works on their behalf. One elderly woman shouted out what others only thought. ""Liar,"" she said. Others echoed her, first hundreds, then thousands. And with the fall of Ceausescu days later, the entire nation had awoken and a people were freed. And here, in 1979, a son of Poland, Pope John Paul the Second, spoke words that would bring down an empire and bring freedom to millions who lived in bondage. ""Be not afraid"" - those words changed the world. I, and my fellow Americans, are inspired by the path of freedom tread by the people of Poland. Long before modern times, of course, the Polish and American people were hardly strangers. The name ""Pulaski"" is honored to this day in America, and so is the memory of other Poles who joined in our fight for independence. Two years after our young republic gave the New World its first freely adopted written constitution. Poland did the same for the Old World, with a preamble that called liberty ""dearer than life."" At every turn in our history, through wars and crises, through every change in the geopolitical map, we have met as friends and allies. That was true in America's Revolutionary War. It was true in the dark days of World War II. And it has been true in Iraq and Afghanistan. There has never been a moment when our peoples felt anything but mutual respect and good will - and that is not common in history. Americans watched with astonishment and admiration, as an electrician led a peaceful protest against a brutal and oppressive regime. ""It has to be understood,"" as President Walesa has recently said, ""that the solidarity movement philosophy was very simple. When you can't lift a weight, you ask someone else for help and to lift it with you."" Of course, among the millions of Poles who said ""yes"", there was one who has a unique and special place in our hearts: Pope John Paul the Second. When he first appeared on the balcony above Saint Peter's Square, a correspondent on the scene wrote to his editor with a first impression. This is not just a pope from Poland, he said, ""This is a pope from Galilee."" In 1979, Pope John Paul the Second celebrated Mass with you in a square not too far from here. He reminded the world there would be no justice in Europe without an independent Poland, and he reminded the Polish people, long deprived of their independence, from where they drew their strength. While greeting a crowd huddled along a fence, he met a little girl. He paused and asked her, ""Where is Poland?"" But the girl - caught off guard - couldn't answer. She laughed nervously until the great pope put his hand over her heart and said: ""Poland is here."" John Paul the Second understood that a nation is not a flag or a plot of land. It is a people - a community of values. And the highest value Poland honors - to the world's great fortune - is man's innate desire to be free. Unfortunately, there are parts of the world today where the desire to be free is met with brutal oppression: Just to the east of here, the people of Belarus suffer under the oppressive weight of dictatorship. The Arab world is undergoing a historic upheaval, one that holds promise, but also risk and uncertainty. A ruthless dictator in Syria has killed thousands of his own people. In Latin America, Hugo Chavez leads a movement characterized by authoritarianism and repression. Nations in Africa are fighting to resist the threat of violent radical jihadism. And in Russia, once-promising advances toward a free and open society have faltered. In a turbulent world, Poland stands as an example and defender of freedom. Only last month, in Gdansk, a sculpture was unveiled of President Reagan and John Paul the Second. As President Walesa told a reporter, ""Reagan should have a monument in every city."" Czeslaw Nowak, recalled the days in 1981 when he, Walesa, and others were imprisoned by the communist regime. Just when it felt like they might be forgotten by the world, the captives learned that in the White House, the President of the United States was lighting candles. It was a demonstration of unity with them - a sign of solidarity. ""When Reagan lit the candles,"" Mr. Nowak recalled, ""we knew we had a friend in the United States."" This is a country that made a prisoner a president ... that went from foreign domination to the proud and independent nation you are today. And now, for both our nations, the challenge is to be worthy of this legacy as we find a way forward. The false gods of the all-powerful state claim the allegiance of a lonely few. It is for us, in this generation and beyond, to show all the world what free people and free economies can achieve for the good of all. Perhaps because here in Poland centralized control is no distant memory, you have brought a special determination to securing a free and prosperous economy. When the Soviet Empire breathed its last, Poland's economy was in a state of perpetual crisis. When economists analyzed it from abroad, one heard talk of the prospect of starvation in major cities. But from the depths of those dark times, this nation's steady rise is a shining example of the prosperity that economic opportunity can bring. Your nation has moved from a state monopoly over the economy, price controls, and severe trade restrictions to a culture of entrepreneurship, greater fiscal responsibility, and international trade. As a result, your economy has experienced positive growth in each of the last twenty years. In that time, you have doubled the size of your economy. The private sector has gone from a mere 15 percent of the economy to 65 percent. And while other nations fell into recession in recent years, you weathered the storm and continued to flourish. When economists speak of Poland today, it is not to lament chronic problems, but to describe how this nation empowered the individual, lifted the heavy hand of government, and became the fastest-growing economy in all of Europe. Yesterday, one of your leaders shared with me an economic truth that has been lost in much of the world: ""It is simple. You don't borrow what you cannot pay back."" The world should pay close attention to the transformation of Poland's economy. A march toward economic liberty and smaller government has meant a march toward higher living standards, a strong military that defends liberty at home and abroad, and an important and growing role on the international stage. Rather than heeding the false promise of a government-dominated economy, Poland sought to stimulate innovation, attract investment, expand trade, and live within its means. Your success today is a reminder that the principles of free enterprise can propel an economy and transform a society. At a time of such difficulty and doubt throughout Europe, Poland's economic transformation over these past 20 years is a fitting turn in the story of your country. In the 1980s, when other nations doubted that political tyranny could ever be faced down or overcome, the answer was, ""Look to Poland."" And today, as some wonder about the way forward out of economic recession and fiscal crisis, the answer once again is ""Look to Poland"". It is not surprising that a people who waited so long, and endured so much, for the sake of liberty, are today enjoying liberty to the fullest. Poland has no greater friend and ally than the people of the United States. You helped us win our independence... your bravery inspired the allies in the Second World War... you helped bring down the Iron Curtain... and your soldiers fought side-by-side with ours in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have fought and died together. We share a common cause, tested by time, inseparable by foe. In times of trouble and in times of peace, we march together. God bless you, God bless America, and God bless the great nation of Poland.  "
Mitt Romney,8/11/2012,"Introducing Vice Presidential Nominee in Norfolk, Virginia",South,"Mitt Romney, Remarks Introducing Representative Paul Ryan as the 2012 Republican Vice Presidential Nominee in Norfolk, Virginia Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/302178","Ladies and gentlemen: It's great to be back in Virginia and here in Norfolk. Your city's beauty is only matched by its proud heritage as a defender of freedom. Today we take another step forward in helping restore the promise of America. As we move forward in this campaign and on to help lead the nation to better days, it is an honor to announce my running mate and the next Vice President of the United States: Paul Ryan. Paul Ryan is a leader. His leadership begins with character and values. And Paul is a man of tremendous character, shaped in large part by his early life. Paul's father died when he was in high school. That forced him to grow up earlier than any young man should. But Paul did, with the help of his devoted mother, his brothers and sister, and a supportive community. And as he did, he internalized the virtues and hard-working ethic of the Midwest. Paul Ryan works in Washington – but his beliefs remain firmly rooted in Janesville, Wisconsin. He is a person of great steadiness, whose integrity is unquestioned and whose word is good. Paul's upbringing is obvious in how he has conducted himself throughout his life, including his leadership in Washington. In a city that is far too often characterized by pettiness and personal attacks, Paul Ryan is a shining exception. He does not demonize his opponents. He understands that honorable people can have honest differences. And he appeals to the better angels of our nature. There are a lot of people in the other party who might disagree with Paul Ryan; I don't know of anyone who doesn't respect his character and judgment. Paul is in public life for all the right reasons – not to advance his personal ambitions but to advance the ideals of freedom and justice; and to increase opportunity and prosperity to people of every class and faith, every age and ethnic background. A faithful Catholic, Paul believes in the worth and dignity of every human life. With energy and vision, Paul Ryan has become an intellectual leader of the Republican Party. He understands the fiscal challenges facing America: our exploding deficits and crushing debt – and the fiscal catastrophe that awaits us if we don't change course. Paul Ryan combines a profound sense of responsibility for what we owe the next generation with an unbounded optimism in America's future and an understanding of all the wonderful things the American people can do. Paul also combines firm principles with a practical concern for getting things done. He has never been content to simply curse the darkness; he would rather light candles. And throughout his legislative career he's shown the ability to work with members of both parties to find common ground on some of the hardest issues confronting the American people. Paul and I are beginning on a journey that will take us to every corner of America. We are offering a positive, governing agenda that will lead to economic growth, to widespread and shared prosperity, and that will improve the lives of our fellow citizens. Our Plan to Strengthen The Middle Class will get America back to work and get our country back on track. We offer solutions that are bold, specific, and achievable. We offer our commitment to help create 12 million new jobs and to bring better take home pay to middle class families. To strengthen the middle class, we will provide our workers and our children with the skills to succeed. We'll cut the deficit, have trade that works for America, and champion small business. And finally, we will unleash our energy resources to achieve North American energy independence. We will help care for those who cannot care for themselves, and we will return work to welfare. As poverty has risen to historic and tragic levels, with nearly one out of six Americans now having fallen into poverty, we will act to bring these families into the middle class. Unlike the current president who has cut Medicare funding by $700 billion, we will preserve and protect Medicare and Social Security. Under the current president, healthcare has only become more expensive. We will reform healthcare so that more Americans have access to affordable healthcare, and we will get that started by repealing and replacing Obamacare. And at a time when the President's campaign is taking American politics to new lows, we are going to do things differently. We are going to talk about aspirations and American ideals; about bringing people together to solve the urgent problems facing our nation. And when that message wins in America, it will be a victory for every American. Today is a good day for America. And there are better days ahead. Join me in welcoming the next Vice President of the United States - Paul Ryan.  "
Mitt Romney,8/14/2012,"Chillicothe, Ohio",Midwest,"Mitt Romney, Remarks In Chillicothe, Ohio Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/302452","Thank you, Ohio.  It's good to be back in the Buckeye State.  And it's a privilege to be here with two good friends - your great governor, John Kasich and your outstanding senator, Rob Portman.  Governor Kasich is doing a great job despite the head winds from Washington. As President, I can't wait to work with Senator Portman to turn those Obama headwinds into pro-job policies that will help working families all across Ohio. Tonight, we're wrapping up our five-state bus tour to towns big and small. That trip reconfirmed to me just how important this election is — and why we need to change the direction of the country by changing the current occupant of the Oval Office. We started out on the decks of a battleship in Norfolk, Virginia, where arbitrary and reckless defense cuts threaten our national security and 150,000 jobs.  From there it was on to North Carolina, through towns that have lost thousands and thousands of manufacturing jobs.  And yesterday we were in Florida, where families are still struggling with the Obama Economy. The people I met on this tour — and the thousands of Americans I've visited in break rooms and lunch rooms, in school gymnasiums and on factory floors — are worried about their children, their jobs, their mortgages, and their future. And they are right to be worried. All across the country, I've met people who are hurting. Some have lost their jobs; others work two jobs just to get by. Some have fallen out of the middle class and now they're struggling to get back to where they started. The cost of living keeps going up, and they're living paycheck to paycheck. They are tired of being tired. And tonight, I'd like to say to each of them:  You have not been forgotten. We will not leave you behind. This is America. We are Americans. It doesn't have to be this way! Unemployment has been above 8 percent for 42 straight months. We will put Americans back to work! Half of recent college graduates can't find work or a job that matches their skills.  We'll get good jobs for our kids. Nearly one out of six Americans are in poverty today. This is a disgrace we will end. And President Obama has amassed five trillion dollars of debt - nearly as much debt held by the public as all other Presidents combined. We will end this moral failure. After four years, it's clear that President Obama's policies aren't fixing these problems, they're making them worse. That is why Ohio will lead the way by electing a new President on November 6th. For the first time, most Americans believe that our best days are behind us. This is an election in which we should be talking about the path ahead, but you don't hear any answers coming from President Obama's re-election campaign. That's because he's intellectually exhausted, out of ideas, and out of energy. And so his campaign has resorted to diversions and distractions, to demagoguing and defaming others. This is an old game in politics; what's different this year is that the president is taking things to a new low. It wasn't supposed to be this way. In 2008, Candidate Obama said, ""if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare voters.""  He said, ""if you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.""  And that, he told us, is how, ""You make a big election about small things."" That was Candidate Obama describing the strategy that is the now the heart of his campaign.    His campaign and his surrogates have made wild and reckless accusations that disgrace the office of the Presidency.  Another outrageous charge came a few hours ago in Virginia. And the White House sinks a little bit lower. This is what an angry and desperate Presidency looks like. President Obama knows better, promised better and America deserves better. Over the last four years, this President has pushed Republicans and Democrats as far apart as they can go.  And now he and his allies are pushing us all even further apart by dividing us into groups. He demonizes some. He panders to others. His campaign strategy is to smash America apart and then cobble together 51 percent of the pieces.   If an American president wins that way, we all lose. But he won't win that way. America is one Nation under God. American history has been a story of the many becoming one - uniting to preserve liberty, uniting to build the greatest economy in the world, uniting to save the world from unspeakable darkness. Everywhere I go in America there are monuments that list those who have given their lives. There is no mention of their race, their party affiliation or what they did for a living. They lived and died under a single flag fighting for a single purpose. They pledged allegiance to the United States of America. So, Mr. President, take your campaign of division and anger and hate back to Chicago and let us get about rebuilding and reuniting America. This election is about restoring the promise of America. It's a choice between two visions for our nation's future. It's about the challenges America faces. It is about a better tomorrow and a better future.       We don't need more excuses. We don't need more blame. We don't need more small-minded attacks. What we really need is a new president. Voters deserve an honest debate. And that's what Paul Ryan and I will give them. Paul and I have a positive agenda that will lead to economic growth, to widespread and shared prosperity that will improve the lives of our fellow citizens. Our Plan For A Stronger Middle Class will get America back to work and get our country back on track. We are offering solutions that are bold, specific, and achievable. We're committed to helping create 12 million new jobs and to bring better take-home pay to middle class families.   My plan focuses on five things. First, energy independence. We will achieve North America energy independence by 2020, by taking full advantage of our oil, our gas, our coal, our renewables and our nuclear power.  Abundant, inexpensive, domestic energy will not only create energy jobs, it will bring back manufacturing jobs. Second, we must give our workers and our children the skills they need to succeed. Our nation cannot continue to fail in public education. For too long, we have let the agenda of union bosses steer the agenda of our schools. It is time to put our kids and their parents and their teachers first, and the union bosses behind. Third, trade must work for America. We are one of the world's most productive nations. Trade creates jobs and raises take-home pay for American workers. We must open more doors for trade in Latin America, where there is a growing middle class. But when any nation cheats, as China has cheated, we must make sure that there are clear and compelling consequences. Fourth, we will do what politicians in both parties have been promising for years, but have failed to do. We will cut spending, shrink deficits, and put America on track to a balanced budget. Fifth, we will champion small business. Unlike President Obama, I won't raise taxes on small business. I'll make sure regulators protect the public, but that they stop killing our jobs. I will remove the crippling uncertainty that is preventing businesses from hiring. That begins by repealing Obamacare.  It's bad for jobs and it's bad for seniors. If the President is re-elected, he will succeed in raiding $716 billion from Medicare -- from the trust fund you have paid into all your lives — to pay for Obamacare. He is taking your money to finance his risky and unproven takeover of the health-care system. He is putting Medicare at greater risk. He is putting health care at greater risk. He is putting your jobs at greater risk.  We must not let Obamacare happen. If we focus on these five areas — energy, education, trade, deficits, and championing small business — America's economy will come roaring back to life.  And we will finally see a comeback for America's middle class. My plan is based on proven principles that will produce real results.  I spent 25 years in business, and I know what it takes for the private sector to create jobs.  I know why jobs go away, what it takes to bring them back, and what we must do to make America the best place in the world for entrepreneurs and innovators and job creators. My five-point plan will bring more jobs and more take-home pay for middle-class Americans. People ask me why I think the President's policies have been such a disappointment. I just don't think President Obama understands what it is that drives our economy. America runs on freedom. Free men and women, pursuing their dreams, working hard to build a better future for their families. This is what propels our economy. When an American succeeds, when she wins a promotion, when he creates a business, it is that individual, that American that has earned it, that has built it. Government does not build our businesses, the American people do. The American people also build the government. We pay for it with our taxes. We choose who will lead us with our votes. Do you want a president who believes that your rights come from God, not from government? Do you want a president who honors your right to pursue happiness, not as government commands, but as you choose? Do you want a president who will work every day to bring us together, not tear us apart? Do you want a president who will celebrate success, not attack it? Do you want a president who will never, ever apologize for the greatest nation on earth? With your support, I will be that President. We are 84 days away from the start of the better future we deserve. We need new leadership, and new ideas, and a new approach — because four years of failure is enough.                         Paul Ryan and I believe in America — and in this election, we're offering Americans a clear and honest choice. Every single day we're going to do our part. And we need you to do yours. I commit to you that I will be the President that this moment demands. I will work to strengthen our families, to rebuild our economy and to keep our military second to none in the world. I ask you to commit like never before over the next 84 days. This election can come down to just one more vote. I ask you find that vote. Ask one more person to join our campaign. Ask one more person to join us who supported President Obama four years ago and didn't get the change they deserved. One more vote can make the difference in Ohio. And Ohio will make the difference for America. Thank you.  God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America.  "
Mitt Romney,9/7/2012,"Campaign Event in Orange City, Iowa",Midwest,"Mitt Romney, Remarks at a Campaign Event in Orange City, Iowa Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/315933","Thank you so very much. What a welcome! Iowa knows how to do it right, I'll tell you that. That's quite a welcome. I —   — thank you, Orange City, Mr. Mayor.   Thank you, Northwestern College. What a welcome. Mr. President, thank you for letting me be on your campus today and bringing a few of your students here with you. How many here are going to Northwestern College? Yeah.   And thank you to Governor Terry Branstad. Isn't this terrific that a guy who had been governor before and moved on to the private sector, was enjoying his career teaching and — and guiding a — a great institution of higher learning. He says, you know, Iowa needs the real kind of leadership that only he could bring. He came back and ran for — for office, is a great governor, has put Iowa — as he just described — on the top charts in terms of the best places to do business, with jobs being created. Thank you, Governor Terry Branstad.   And thank you to Orange City for doing such a great job on electing people who believe in conservative principles, who love the Constitution and will stand for the principles that America was based upon. Thank you.   Now, I have to tell you, I know there's a lot of bad news out there. But I'm looking beyond the bad news. I'm looking over the hill and seeing what's going to happen just down the road a bit. And what's going to happen is America's about to come roaring back. I'm absolutely convinced —   — look, this is the greatest nation in the history of the earth. The principles upon which this country was founded, those principles are — are — are continuing to guide and inspire the people of America and people around the world. And if we restore those principles, you're going to see our economy come roaring back. And with a strong economy, we can maintain the strongest military in the world. The world depends on a strong America. I was in Poland some weeks ago and met with Lech Walesa. I came in the — his meeting area there, and he said, Mr. Romney, you must be tired from coming across the — the ocean. He said, why don't you sit down, and I'll talk. And I sat down, and — and he began to speak. And he — what he said for about 15 minutes was — boiled down to this. He said, where is America's leadership? We need America's leadership. America must lead. There's no question about the principles of freedom and personal responsibility and dignity that have always formed the basis of America. Those principles need to be spoken loud and clear and demonstrated on the world stage, and I will do it again.   Now, yesterday — yesterday you had the chance, if you wanted to, to watch the president of the United States address the people of America in his acceptance speech. And I read that this morning — you haven't perhaps got a chance to do that. But if you did, perhaps, like me, you found it extraordinarily disappointing, surprisingly disappointing, because his speech four years ago, he laid out a whole series of lofty goals. And unfortunately, he was unable to meet them. As a matter of fact, I can think of very few of the promises he made four years ago that he's kept. He — he said he'd raise incomes for people. In fact, they've gone down by $5,000 a family. He said he'd create more new businesses. People who wanted to start a business would be encouraged to do so. But in fact, we're at a 30-year low in new business startups. He was going to get the people back to work. His — you remember with his — his stimulus plan? The stimulus said that if we let him borrow $787 billion, he would hold unemployment below 8 percent. It's been 43 straight months above 8 percent. There are today 23 million Americans that are out of work or stopped looking for work or underemployed. It's a national tragedy. He also said he'd cut the deficit in half. He doubled it. One promise he kept, though. He said if his energy policies got put in place, the cost of energy would skyrocket, and that's happened. [laughter] This is time for a new president —   — with a different vision for America. Now, I was —   — I was surprised by his address because I — I expected him to confront the major challenge of the last four years, which is an economy which has not produced the jobs that the American people need. I expected him to talk about 23 million people or at least to talk about the unemployed in America. I expected him to talk about the number of families having a hard time making ends meet, the number of middle-income families who've seen the cost of health insurance go up, the cost of food go up, the cost of gasoline go up, even as their incomes have gone down. I expected him to talk about those things, but he did not. Instead, it was a whole series of new promises which he also won't be able to keep because the policies he believes in and the direction he's pulling will not make America stronger. If President Obama were re-elected, we would have four more years of the last four years, and the American people are going to say to — no to that.   Now, there's something else that you've watched in the president's campaign over the past several months, and that is an increasingly divisive and dismissive approach to the American people. It's been a campaign of pitting one American against another, and it's so contrary to our national history and our national spirit. The story of America has been one of the many becoming one. The story of America is a united people coming to build the strongest economy in the history of the world. The story has — a united people that has confronted unspeakable darkness and stopped it from spreading across the earth in the Second World War — and fighting it again, time and again, when — when evil rears its head around the world. As Lech Walesa indicated, America's leadership has been needed and is needed today. That's been the story of America: People coming together. And one thing I can assure you, if — is that if I'm president of the United States, I will stop this divisiveness and I will do everything in my power to unite the American people.   Now, you might have — you might have expected the president of the United States to lay out a plan for what he'd do to get the economy going again and get people working again. And he didn't do that last night. Again that was surprising to me. I laid out the things I'm going to do to get this economy going. And let me tell you what they are, one by one, five things. You've heard me talk about them before. I want to talk about them some more because I want you to know I'm not just talking about 12 million new jobs. I know how to get the private sector to create 12 million new jobs. I know what it's going to take to do that.   Let me tell you what they are. Number one, I'm going to take full advantage of our energy resources, our coal, our oil, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.   And — and by doing that, we become energy independent, North America does, by 2020. Now, you might think, well, how do you get there? Let me tell you some of the things you do. One, you take full advantage of what's known as tight oil. That's oil that's in tight formations, and they pump in fluid to push it out, get more oil out. It also means taking advantage of that pipeline from Canada, getting that oil coming out from Canada, the Keystone pipeline.   It means turning the Gulf of Mexico back on so we get oil out of the Gulf. And by the way, over the last four years the president has cut the number of permits and licenses on federal land and in federal waters in half. I will double the number of licenses and permits so we get more oil and energy.   And natural gas is our big ace in the hole. We got a lot of natural gas. That natural gas being brought to our transportation hubs, that natural gas being brought to places where — where now they don't have it, particularly in the manufacturing sector, is going to bring jobs back to America. So number one for me is taking advantage of our energy resources, and that will put millions of Americans back to work. Number two —   — and I'm looking here at Steve King. This man needs to be your congressman again. I want him as my partner in Washington, D.C.   Number two, I want to make sure that our workers have the skills for this jobs of today and that you young people have the skills you need for the jobs of tomorrow. And that latter request and that latter demand suggest that we finally have to make sure that our schools are run for the benefit of the students, that we put the students and their parents and the teachers first, and the teachers' union, they're going to have to go behind. We've got to have our —   — our kids run for our — our schools run for our kids. Let me mention a third, and that's — and that's trade. The third thing I'm going to do is really take advantage of trade opportunities. You see, America is the most productive nation on the planet of the major economic powers. That means we make more stuff per person than any other nation. And because we make more stuff per person, we're the most productive. And therefore it's good for us to trade with other nations. As we do, we'll create more jobs. You know that here in Iowa. You ship products, whether agricultural or manufactured, or services, around the world. It creates jobs here in Iowa to trade. And this president is the first since Roosevelt, FDR, not to — to seek and receive trade promotion authority to be able to work out new trade deals with other nations. I'm going to fight for the capacity to create new trade opportunities. And because I spent my life in the private sector, 25 years, I understand what kind of deals are good for America and which aren't. So I'm going to make trade work for America. And by the way, if nations we trade with decide to take advantage of us unfairly, and cheat, there'll be consequences. I will finally do what needs to be done to make sure China doesn't cheat and take our jobs.   Number four — number four — and this is one that is not just economic, it's also moral, as the governor said. And that is it is simply wrong for us — morally wrong for us — to continue to spend massively more than we take in year-in and year-out knowing that my generation will never pay that back, it's all going to be passed on to your generation. We are killing the American dream for our children. It's wrong. It will stop if I'm president of the United States.   I've got one more. I've got one more, and that's this. I'm going to champion small business. You see, I happen to understand how it is that small businesses get going and how it is they grow. I — I — as I was driving in to Orange City, I saw a Staples distribution facility there, a big sign said Staples. I hope you saw that.   As — as you know, I — I was one of those that helped finance the very first Staples store. I remember going to the store the night before it opened and talking to the various folks that were putting various products on the shelf. We wondered what would happen. Would people come to our store or not? And I remember talking to one of the founders, and I said, what do we do if no one comes? He said, that's easy — lower prices and advertise more. And I said, well, what happens if they still don't come? He said, that's easy — lower prices some more and advertise some more. And so that little one store, in a place called Brighton, Massachusetts, has now grown to be hundreds, thousands of stores worldwide, with distribution centers here and all over the country. It's a remarkable story. It's the story of America, how individuals pursuing their dreams in fact built it themselves and —   — and by virtue of their dreams and a great nation that welcomes dreamers and the support of all the people that work at an enterprise like Staples, they were able to create a business which employs about 90,000 Americans today. So I know that to get Americans back to work and to create the 12 million jobs I'm dedicated to creating, I have to create the conditions and the environment that encourages entrepreneurs and innovators and small businesspeople to start businesses and to grow them. And for that to happen, there are a couple of things I've got to do. One, I want them to know that if they're successful, if they're one of the very few of the startups that actually makes it, that they'll be able to keep a good deal of their own profits, their own earnings, and be able to plow it into the business to grow, because if you raise taxes on small business, a lot of them won't even start and those that do won't be able to grow. So for me, holding down taxes on small business is essential. And number two, I want regulators to know their job, yes, is to catch the bad guys — there will always be bad guys out there; you got to catch them. But you also have to recognize that your job is to encourage the good guys. Regulators and regulations have to encourage small business —   — make it easier to grow, get behind our enterprises. And then if you really want to help small business, if you really want to help small business, you have to take that cloud off of them, that cloud that's keeping so many small businesses from adding employment. The Chamber of Commerce carried out a survey. They asked businesses all over America, what's the impact of a particular piece of legislation, and the people came back — 75 percent of the people surveyed said that piece of legislation keeps us from hiring people. That legislation we have to get rid of is known as ""Obamacare,"" and I'm going to get rid of it.   Now that doesn't mean — that doesn't mean we're not going to make improvements to our health care system. We — we know that health care's too expensive. ""Obamacare"" doesn't make it less expensive. When the president ran for office, he said he'd cut premiums by $2,500 per family. ""Obamacare"" passes. Now, by the way, they're up $2,500 a family. That's a $5,000 difference. And median family income in America of $50,000, about, that $5,000 is a huge impact — AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right. MR. ROMNEY: — has a huge impact. I'm going to go after getting the costs of health care to get reined in, mostly going to make — and by the way, I'm going to do that by taking on malpractice. I'm going to do that by letting individuals be able to buy their own insurance —   — without just getting it from their company. And — and of course in health care we have to make sure that people who have pre-existing conditions are able to get insured and that — and that folks that — that get sick don't get dropped by their insurance company. There are a lot of things that we can do to improve, but we don't have to have ""Obamacare"" that raises taxes, we don't have to have ""Obamacare"" that cuts Medicare by $716 billion. We're going to get rid of ""Obamacare,"" restore funding to Medicare and keep the promises we've made to our seniors.   I have to tell you, I'm excited about what I see ahead. I'm absolutely convinced the American people are going to take a good, careful look at both people running for president and they're going to ask themselves, what do I want going forward? Do I want a president that's continue — going to continue the policies that he put in place over the last four years that led to record levels of unemployment — [booing] — what, now 43 straight months above 8 percent — did you see the jobs report this morning, by the way? Ninety — ninety-five thousand, I believe, net new jobs created and almost 400,000 people dropped out of the workforce altogether. [boos] It's — it's simply unimaginable. The president said that by this time we'd be at 5.4 percent unemployment. Instead, we're at about 8 percent. And you know the difference that that makes, and how many people would be working in America? Nine million people. Had he been able to keep his promise, had his — had his policies worked as he thought they would, there would be 9 million more Americans working. If that had been the case, we'd have a lot better budget setting — we'd have a lot better family life in this country, where people are struggling to make ends meet. We wouldn't have many kids wondering, whether when they get home at night mom and dad will be there, because with two jobs, trying to make ends meet, they can't be there. We wouldn't have as many seniors wondering whether they're going to be able to put food on the table at the end of the week. We wouldn't have as many young people wondering whether they can afford college next semester. Wouldn't have as many college graduates asking themself, can I possibly find a job when half today of our college graduates can't find work or work consistent with a college degree. Look, this is important. Nine million people. This president tried, but he didn't understand what it takes to make our economy work. I do. I will use that experience to get Americans to work again.   At the Democratic convention, they had that video that said that we all belong to the government. [boos] Boy, they sure got that one wrong, didn't they? The government belongs to us, and we —   — and we value the government we have. And we pay for it, too. It ain't free. And — and we want that government to encourage and protect our freedoms, to honor its promises, to create the conditions that make it easier for small businesses and entrepreneurs and innovators and students coming out of school to be able to begin their life. That's what I'm dedicated to doing. I love this country. I love the principles upon which it was founded. I don't want to transform America into Europe. I don't want a bigger and bigger government, more and more intrusive, telling us how to live our lives. I instead want a government which encourages individual initiative and freedom. I will be a president who will never say to you you didn't build it. If you get the honor roll, I'll congratulate you, not the bus driver that got you to school.   I believe in individual achievement. Now, one more thing I just want to — want to say to — to you that are going to college here. You've got friends that are going to college here and around — around Iowa and around the country, and you're going to have a big say. You may even have the deciding say as to who the next president is. And I know that the president and his party are going to everything in their power to convince you to vote — to vote for them. But I want you to ask this question: Who is dedicated to making sure we don't pass on trillion dollars of debt to you? I am. My party is. We're absolutely committed to making sure you're able to live the American dream. The other party will promise you lots of free stuff. But then ask them how are they paying for it and they say, oh, we're borrowing money from China to do that.   And guess who's going to pay the interest on that? Guess who's going to pay the interest? Guess who's going to pay it back all their lives? You are. Look, I want — I want the young — I see a sign up there — 16 trillion (dollars) in debt — thanks for making that; thanks for reminding us. By the way, the — Governor Branstad and I, we won't be paying that back, you see. We'll both be gone when that's paid back. You guys will be paying for that. You're going to pay the interest on it. You're going to pay the interest, and it's going to get larger and larger till that interest swamps even more than our total defense budget. That's what's going to happen unless we get serious about reining in the excesses of government. The president's answer — we all respect our government, but we don't want it to get so big that is crushes the dreams of the American people, and I will fight for the young people of America by getting us finally on track to a balanced budget. (Extended cheers, applause.) You guys, we're going to win this thing. This day we're stepping forward, we're taking back America, we're going to make sure that America remains the hope of the earth. We're going to keep America the shining city on a hill Ronald Reagan spoke of. I love this country. I love the people of America. I believe in the people of America, and we're going to take back America and keep it strong. Thank you so very much!   Thank you!  "
Mitt Romney,9/8/2012,"Campaign Event in Virginia Beach, Virginia",South,"Mitt Romney, Remarks at a Campaign Event in Virginia Beach, Virginia Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/315928","Look at those flags!   Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Well, Virginia really knows how to say hello. Thank you!   Thank you, Governor and Janine, for being here and welcoming me. And thanks to all of you for braving the warm weather today to give me such a welcome. And thanks to our veterans. I see a number of them in the audience here today. Thank you for your service.   You know, I know that this week has not been a week of a lot of good news. You saw the reports that we're not creating as many jobs as even would keep up with our population growth and you saw that for every net new job that was created last month, why, four people dropped out of the workforce. So this is not the kind of news that the American people were hoping for and deserved. But I'm here to tell you that things are going to get a lot better.   But that's going to require you doing something important and that's electing me the next president of the United States.   AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! MR. ROMNEY: You know, it's moving to be in this place and to see these aircraft and know the men and the women that have helped defend liberty for America time and time again. It's moving to see that flag out there and to see the flags that you've been waving inside this room. I remember as a boy I was in the fourth grade and somehow in my mind I remember being there in the fourth grade in front of the blackboard. We had an American flag that was pinned above the blackboard. And every day we stood, lined up in front of that blackboard and we recited the Pledge of Allegiance. Do you remember it?   I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.   When I make a promise, I intend to keep a promise and I've done that throughout my life. When I made that promise time and time again in my pledge of allegiance to the flag I remembered that flag and I remember it to this day For me, the Pledge of Allegiance and placing our hand over our heart reminds us of the blood that was shed by our sons and our daughters fighting for our liberty and sharing liberty with people around the world. The promises that were made in that pledge are promises I plan on keeping if I'm president and I've kept them so far in my life.   That pledge says under God. I will not take God out of the name of our platform.   I will not take God off our coins and I will not take God out of my heart. We're a nation —   — bestowed by God. One nation, indivisible — I will not divide this nation. I will not apologize for America abroad and I will not apologize for Americans here at home.   With liberty and justice for all — with liberty — I will not forget that for us to have liberty here, for us to be able to protect ourselves from the most evil around the world, for us to share liberty with our friends around the world, we must have a military second to none, so strong no one would ever think of testing it.   And I'm sure you know what's happening to our military. Our number of ships has gone from roughly 600 down — well, the Navy said they had to have at least 313 ships minimum to carry out the missions that are given to our Navy and we're already down to about 282, 283, something of that nature. And we're only creating about nine new ships a year. I'd increase that to 15 ships. Do you realize —  . You realize our Navy is smaller than any time since 1917. That's unacceptable. It's time to have a rebuilding of our Navy to make sure it's the strongest in the world.   And it fulfills our missions. Our Air Force is older and smaller than any time since 1947. Our troops have been stretched to the breaking point in the conflicts they've been enduring. And our hearts go to those that are in far off places today, particularly those in Afghanistan and who are harm's way. We love them. We respect them. We honor their sacrifice.   But to preserve liberty, we must have a commitment not just to more ships and more aircraft but also in my view to more members of our Armed Forces. I will not cut our military. I will maintain our military commitment.   Now, I listened — you listened to the governor talk about the cuts the president has put in place for our military. And then the sequestration cuts that the White House came up with, this idea of sequestration — they came up with it. According to a book that just came out from Bob Woodward, it was their idea. So we're talking about a trillion dollars in cuts. The estimates of the kinds of numbers of jobs lost in Virginia from these cuts is between a hundred and two hundred thousand. It's unthinkable. It's unthinkable to Virginia, to our employment needs. But it's also unthinkable to the ability and the commitment of America to maintain our liberty with liberty for all. And therefore, if I'm president of the United States, we'll get rid of those sequestration cuts and rebuild America's military might.   So with liberty for all but also with justice for all — with justice for all — I don't think it's just for the next generation for us to pass on massive debts that we've amassed and pass onto them. Sixteen trillion dollars in debt passed to them is wrong and it must end.   I also don't think it's justice for all when a nation is as prosperous as ours is — the most prosperous, major nation in the history of the Earth — to have one out of six people now who've fallen into poverty, 47 million people on food stamps. When the president took office, there were 32 million on food stamps, now 47 million. How can a nation — how can a nation so prosperous stand by with such a national tragedy? That is not justice for all. Now with the unemployment level having stuck above 8 percent for 43 straight months, we remember that the president promised that if we let him borrow almost a trillion dollars he'd never let it reach 8 percent. It's been above 8 percent. This president has not fulfilled his promises. And then he went to the Democrat Convention and spoke at great length and had a lot of wonderful things to say. But he didn't say what he'd do to help people get jobs or come out of employment — out of unemployment or to get people that are poor back to the middle class. He doesn't have a plan. He doesn't have any ideas. And we've got to make sure that he doesn't have any more days in the White House after January.   We pledge allegiance to that flag. We believe in a nation under God, indivisible, a nation united, a nation with justice and liberty for all. And for that to happen, we're going to have to have a new president that will commit to getting America working again, that will commit to a strong military, that will commit to a nation under God, that recognizes that we the American people were given our rights not by government but by God Himself.   Now, unlike the president, you see, the president has promises and I have promises. But the difference is that I have a plan to fulfill my promises. And so — and so I have — I have a plan to get America working again. And I know it's going to work because for me this is not something I studied in school. It's something I did for 25 years, all right?   And so there are five parts to it. Number one — and by the way, this is our ace in the hole. We've got extraordinary resources we haven't taken advantage of and I will. I'm going to get North America energy independent within eight years.   And by the way, that means — that means instead of doing what the president did which is cutting in half the permits and licenses for onshore drilling and offshore drilling on federal lands, I'll double them. And I'm going to open up ANWR and the outer continental shelf.   Yeah, let's not forget about building that pipeline in from Canada too. I'll do that too.   Number two, I'm going to make sure that our workers have the skills they need to succeed today and that our kids get the skills they need to succeed in a world where right now our kids are getting an education which puts them in the bottom third of the world. That's unacceptable. I will put the kids and their parents and the teachers first and the teachers union behind.   Number three, trade is good for us, by the way. It's good for us to sell things to other countries and to trade with them. You have to make sure, of course, that those trade agreements are structured in a way that it helps America, not just the other guys. Trade has to work for us and I'll do that opening up new markets for us. And when people cheat like China's cheating, I'm going to say, no, we're not going to let it go on.   Number four, we're not going to get entrepreneurs to risk their life savings to start a business or big companies — let's say even foreign companies coming here and building facilities here — unless they know we're not on a road to Greece. And so to preserve and to protect jobs and to create more investment in this country, I'm going to do something politicians have spoken about but your governor has done and I've done. Almost every governor in America does it and that is I'm going to cut spending and finally get America on to a balanced budget.   And number five — number five — number five, I'm going to champion small business. Small business is where jobs come from.   So I'm not going to raise taxes on small business and I'm not going to overregulate small business. And I'm going to get rid of that big cloud that's been hanging over small business and keeps them from hiring. I'm going to get rid of ""Obamacare"" and replace it with something better.   AUDIENCE: Romney! Romney! Romney! MR. ROMNEY: Look, this country's going to come roaring back. If you do those five things, this country's going to come roaring back. We're going to see 12 million new jobs and finally rising take-home pay again because I know if government is doing the job it ought to do to encourage freedom and entrepreneurship that the American people are ready to act. I've seen big companies that want to act and want to invest in America. I've seen entrepreneurs of all kinds that want to start businesses. I've been impressed by the American spirit of people who are can-do and take charge, want to start and build things. And by the way, they do build it themselves.   With those flags waving, I can't help but tell you just a story. I know it's warm for this experience but I've been touched by all these flags and the patriotism in this place today. And it happens to do with the Olympics that I had the chance to help organize back in 2002 out in Salt Lake City. And at the end of the Games, Vice President Cheney came and he asked me to pick one athlete to represent all the athletes of America to sit with him in the closing ceremonies. And so, I chose Derrick Parra. Derrick's Hispanic American, born in L.A. He's a roller-blader, all right? and he had a friend say to him, Derrick, you're never going to get an Olympic medal with roller blades, all right? You've got to find another sport. So Derrick decided to try ice skating and it turns out he was pretty fast. And he went on and competed. And you know, he beat these big guys from Michigan and Wisconsin and Minnesota and became a member of the U.S. speed skating team, came out there to Salt Lake City, skated his heart out. He won a silver medal in the — I think it was in the 1,000 meters and then a gold medal in the 5,000 meters — the other way around, gold in the 1,000 and silver in the 5,000 — fastest man in the world on ice. I couldn't get over it. Derrick Parra's about 5'4, real strong guy, just amazing guy. So I invited him to sit with the vice president. He came in to sit down. I said — I said, Derrick, what was the most meaningful experience in your Olympics. I expected him to describe the race for the gold where he got the gold. Instead, he said, no, Mitt, it was being honored to carry in the flag that had flown above the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001, into the opening ceremonies.   You see, that flag was flown above the World Trade Center. It was torn and burned and it's about 8 feet by 12 feet and Derrick Parra was one of the eight American athletes that was voted as one of those that should carry in that flag. And so, in fact he said that he took ahold of the flag and the announcer came over the PA system. And he said, ladies and gentlemen, the flag that flew above the World Trade Center at September the 11th is now coming into the stadium. And Derrick said, I thought the crowd would burst into cheers but instead total silence, complete reverence. And he said, so we carried the flag and stopped in front of the choir and they began performing the national anthem. And he said, Mitt, it was hard to hold on to my emotions as I was singing those words and I was holding that flag. And then he said, the choir did something I hadn't expected. Now, I knew it was coming because as the guy in charge of the Olympics, I chose the version of the national anthem they sang. And in the version I chose, you sing the last line twice. Second time is a reprise. You go up an octave. So the sopranos jumped up an octave, much greater orchestration: O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave, o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave And he said, Mitt, this time as they sang it, a gust of wind blew in the flag in our hands and it lifted in our arms. And he said, for me, it was as if the spirits of all those that had fought and died for liberty had just blown in that flag. And he said, the tears ran down my face. We're a patriotic people. The American people love this country. We love that flag. We love our pledge. We love our God.   Any challenge we face is a challenge we're going to overcome. But we need a new president to get America back on track. I expect to build a new future, a strong future for this country and take back America. I love America. I love you. I love the work you do. I'll protect this land and keep it strong and create the future for your kids they deserve. Thank you so very much! Thank you!    "
Mitt Romney,9/11/2012,"134h National Guard Association of the United States General Conference and Exhibition in Reno, Nevada",West,"Mitt Romney, Remarks at the 134th National Guard Association of the United States General Conference and Exhibition in Reno, Nevada Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/302959","Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much, please. Thank you.   Major General Vavala, thank you for your generous introduction and thank you for your years of service as chairman of the board and for your decades of service to our nation. Ladies and gentlemen of the National Guard Association, it's an honor to be with you on this day of memorial and of appreciation. We remember with heavy hearts the tragic loss of life, and we express thankfulness for the men and women who responded to that tragedy. We honor them, and we honor those who secure our safety even to this day. We honor the men and women of the National Guard. For 375 years, whenever your countrymen have encountered threat and danger, you have willingly gone. Wherever the cause of freedom has called, you have answered. And as the threats to liberty have emanated from distant lands, you've served far from home and far from family. The nation has asked much of you, much more than had been expected. But you never faltered, never wavered from your mission, from that motto: ""Always ready, always there."" Several weeks ago I saw the guard in action in Louisiana after it was hit by Hurricane Isaac. For many people of the Gulf who had just finished repairing their homes and getting life back to normal after Katrina, the damage from Isaac felt like too much to bear. As I toured the flooded streets, I was not surprised to find the guard keeping order, distributing water and supplies, and caring for many of those who had been evacuated and — and rescued. Time and again, it has been the guardsman's hand that has lifted a child from rising waters, that has rescued a family from a hurricane's fury and that has fed and clothed a fellow American whose home and possessions have been lost to nature's devastation. It's a guardsman who took out Saddam Hussein's tanks from his A-10 and who fought the secure the villages of Afghanistan. Thank you for that service.   As you know too well, our world is a dangerous place, and the attack on our homeland and citizens on September 11th, 2001, reminds us that the mission of the guard is ever more critical and ever more deserving of our support and honor. More than a decade has now passed since that day of tragedy, but the visions and the events are seared in the memory of every American. We remember those who died. We marvel at the courage of those who stormed the cockpit when they became aware of the malevolent purpose of the hijackers. We hold up in prayer the families and friends who've lived in a shadow cast by grief. We draw strength from the selflessness of the first responders, and we renew our resolve to protect America from the designs of evil men. Like you, I remember where I was on September 11th. I was originally planning to be in Battery Park in New York City, not far from the World Trade Center itself. But as it turned out, I was in Washington, D.C., to meet with members of Congress about preparations for the security of the upcoming Olympic Winter Games. A colleague and I were working in the office we had in the Ronald Reagan building. It was just a few blocks from the White House. Someone rushed into our office and said that a plane had hit the World Trade Center. I turned on the small TV on our desk there and — and watched in shock as the flames and smoke erupted from the north tower. I called my wife, Ann. She too watched the tragedy from her TV and wondered how a plane could fly into a building in clear daylight. And then we saw the second plane crash into the second tower. These then were purposeful attacks. These were terrorist attacks. These were evil and cowardly and heinous attacks. Leaving the city, I — I drove towards Alexandria. The highway I was on came within a few hundred yards of the Pentagon, which had been hit by then. Cars were stopped where they were, and people had gotten out, watching in horror. I could smell burning fuel and concrete and steel. It was the smell of war, something I never imagined I would smell in America. In our own ways, we each were overwhelmed by the enormity of the loss of life. We struggled to comprehend the magnitude of what this meant for the families of those who had been killed, and for our own families, for our nation, for the world. For some, there was also anger. But grief and anger soon turned to action. And among those taking the lead were members of the National Guard. Members of the guard secured our airports and borders, and members of the guard began to mobilize, to deploy half a world away, where you would become all too familiar with the mountains of the Hindu Kush and the streets of Fallujah. Throughout the last 11 years, guardsmen and women have helped keep us safe from attack, and the nation owes you a great debt of gratitude. I wish I could say the world is less dangerous now, that it's less chaotic. I wish I could predict with certainty the threats we'll face in the years ahead. But on September 10th, 2001, we had no idea that America would be at war in Afghanistan someday. In December of 2010, we had no idea that a Tunisian street vendor would inspire a revolution that would topple three dictators. We live in a time of turbulence and disruption. What I can say with certainty is that we need the National Guard's vigilance and strength now as much as ever before. With less than two months to go before Election Day, I would normally speak to a gathering like this about the differences between my and my opponent's plans for military and for our national security. There is a time and place for that, but this day is not that. It is instead a day to express gratitude to the men and women who fought, and who are still fighting, to protect us and our country, including those who traced the trail of terror to that walled compound in Abbottabad, and the SEALs who delivered justice to Osama bin Laden.   This is also a day in which all of us in this convention hall and in this campaign and in this country can hopefully agree on important things. This century must be an American century. It began with terror, war and economic calamity. It is now our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom, peace and prosperity. America must lead the free world, and the free world must lead the entire world. In our dealings —   — in the dealings we have with other nations, we must demonstrate confidence in our cause, clarity in our purpose and resolve in the application of our military might. For this to be an American century, we must have a military that is second to none, that is so strong, no one would ever think of testing it.   American military power is vital to the preservation of our own security and for the preservation of peace around the world. Time and again America's military has been the best ally of liberty and peace. American forces rescued Europe twice. American forces stood up to brutal dictators and freed millions living under tyranny. America's military leads the fight against terrorism around the world, and it secures the global commons to keep them safe for the trade and commerce that are vital to lifting people from poverty. While the war in Iraq is over, nearly 70,000 American troops will still remain in Afghanistan at the end of the month. Our goals should be to complete a successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014. We should evaluate conditions on the ground and solicit the best advice of our military commanders. We can all agree that our men and women in the field deserve a clear mission, that they deserve the resources and resolute leadership they need to complete that mission and that they deserve a country that will provide for their needs when they come home.   Of course, the return of our troops cannot and must not be used as an excuse to hollow out our military through devastating defense budget cuts.   It is true that our armed forces have been stretched to the brink, and that's all the more reason to repair and rebuild. We can always find places to end waste, but we cannot cancel program after program, we cannot jeopardize critical missions, and we cannot cut corners in the quality of the equipment and training we provide to our men and women in uniform.   We've got to recognize that when our troops come home, they should not have to struggle to find work. After all our veterans have done for us, they deserve the opportunity to find good jobs and the dignity of pursuing of the American dream.   We've also got to keep the faith with our veterans, no matter when or where they've served, through a strong VA system. When the backlog for disability claims reaches nearly a million, when a federal building in Virginia becomes structurally unstable because so many claims have piled up on its highest floor, then we can all agree that the system is in need of serious and urgent reform — and it is.   Our veterans deserve care and benefits that are second to none. Here there's considerable work waiting to be done. The backlog of disability claims need to be — needs to be eliminated, the unconscionable waits for mental health treatment need to be dramatically shortened and the suicide rate among active-duty soldiers and veterans must be treated like the emergency it is. Veterans' benefits are not a gift that is given, but a debt that is due.   The problems with the VA are serious and they've got to be fixed. We're in danger of another generation of veterans losing their faith in the VA system, so we must ensure that the VA keeps faith with all our veterans. We must keep our promises and regain the trust of all those who've worn the uniform and served our country. When I was governor of Massachusetts, I saw firsthand the guard's bravery and valor. In 2006 I visited Iraq and Afghanistan along with two other governors. We met with the members of the National Guard from our respective states and were flown by helicopter from base to base. I said to them that if they wanted me to call their spouse or their family when I got home, I'd be happy to do that; just hand me a note with your name and their names and phone numbers. And so when I left for home, I found that I had 63 notes in my pocket, 63 calls to make. I — I knew that making that many calls would take quite a few days or weeks. I returned home on Memorial Day weekend, and I decided to start making just a couple of calls first thing in the morning, before my kids and grandkids got up. After I'd made only two or three calls, a guardsman's wife answered the phone, and she said this: Oh, hello, Governor. I thought that might be you calling. [laughter] Now apparently, the first spouses I called had called other spouses or they'd emailed their loved ones in Iraq and Afghanistan, who then emailed their spouses back home to tell them to expect my call. So I made 63 calls on Memorial Day. [laughter and applause] Now you'll remember that May of 2006 was a difficult time in the Iraq War. Many of you know that from experience. We were suffering terrible casualties, and terrorism was straining our efforts to stand up the Iraqi government. The surge had not yet begun, and the politics back home had become very deeply divided. And so as I made those calls, I braced myself for questions about why the guardsmen I had met couldn't come home right away. Why were they still there? And yet in 63 calls, I did not hear a single complaint, not one. On each call, I would end by expressing my gratitude on behalf of our nation and my state for the sacrifice of their loved one and of their family, these individuals in harm's way, so far away. And then from virtually everyone I spoke with, they would correct me to say instead that it was an honor to be able to sacrifice for America and to serve the greatest nation on earth.   Such is the patriotism of the men and women and families of our National Guard. Many of those calls left me with tears in my eyes. I'll never forget meeting the brave men and women who had volunteered for the National Guard in Massachusetts, who found themselves on the front lines in Iraq and Afghanistan. I'll never forget speaking with their loved ones. And I'll always hold the greatest admiration for every one of them. On the campaign trail, it's been my privilege to meet with troops and veterans from just about every corner of America. They come from our farms, our great cities, our small towns and quiet neighborhoods. Many have known violence so their neighbors could know peace. They have done more than protect America; their courage and service defines America.   On this 11th anniversary of September 11th of 2001, we remember the victims who perished in the attacks. We also remember the men and women serving in dangerous places around the world. We will not forget why they are fighting or who they are fighting for. They are faithful to us and to our country. We must not break faith with them. I want to personally thank you for keeping us safe. It's inspiring to be in the company of men and women of the National Guard, men and women of courage that I stand before today. It's an honor to be among those who — whose sense of duty and love of country lift our hearts and our spirits. We're blessed to live in a country where freedom is so highly cherished, where it is so fiercely protected and where it's so admirably defended by the noble men and women of the National Guard. I respect you. I admire you. I respect and admire the men and women who serve with you. You are a great force for good in America and in the world. Our debt of gratitude can never be repaid expect by saying, God bless you, God bless the United States of America, and God bless the great people of the National Guard. Thank you so very much.    "
Mitt Romney,9/14/2012,"Campaign Event in Painseville, Ohio",Midwest,"Mitt Romney, Remarks at a Campaign Event in Painseville, Ohio Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/315907","Ohio is committed, I'll tell you that. They're committed.   I can't get over you guys standing out here in the rain. You are the best. Thank you so much.   I love Ohio. I love America. I love you guys. Thank you so much for welcoming me here today. [cheers] Now, we come together in celebration as Americans and think about our future as a nation, but I also want you to know that in the last few moments, the bodies of four individuals who were killed in the service of our nation were brought back to the United States and welcomed home and placed in hearses. And one of the reasons that we delayed my coming out is I wanted to make sure and have my hand over my heart in recognition of these men and women. Let me just remind you of their names. And you know the ambassador, Christopher Stevens, but there were three other individuals who were lost in that tragedy: Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods and Sean Smith. And I'd ask that you might each place your hand over your heart in recognition of the blood shed for freedom by them and by other — our other sons and daughters who've lost their lives in the cause of America and the cause of liberty, and if we'll take a moment of silence together. (Moment of silence observed.) Thank you so much. Thank you for the memories of great men and women who love this country and who serve this country. And whether on a day like this, where the sky seems to be crying as well, or whether on a beautiful and sunny day, we remember those who serve and provide us with the liberty that we enjoy and the prosperity and the freedoms that are so much a part of the American experience. I love America. I love what we stand for. I'm proud of America.   I have to tell you that this experience today reminds me a bit of a time when I was serving as the governor of my state and I got a call from the airport that one of the servicemen of our state had been killed and his remains were coming back to Massachusetts, and they had called his parents to ask them to come to the airport to receive his body. But they lived so far away, they couldn't get there in time to receive his remains, and they asked if I could go in their stead. And so I went to the airport. We drove out on the tarmac, and this U.S. Air jet came in and all the passengers got off the aircraft, and then all the luggage came down the conveyor, and then finally a casket appeared and was brought down the conveyor. And as it was, I — I put my hand over my heart, and the state troopers who were there with me, they all went to attention and saluted, and of course the members of the armed forces who were receiving the casket and putting it in the hearse, they also stood at attention and saluted. And I happened to glance up at the terminal — the U.S. Air terminal there. There's a big glass window, a big wall there at the terminal, where it seems that the people who had gotten off the airplane, they saw all the police out there, wondered what was going on, so they were all lined up against the glass. And then all the people walking down the halls, they saw the people lined up against the glass, so they crowded in behind them to see what was going on. And as I looked up there, every single person I saw had their hand over their heart. We're a patriotic nation. We love this country.   We love the men and women who serve in this country.   Now, we face real challenges, and I want to talk about some of the challenges we face here in Ohio and at home right now. This is not exactly the way things are supposed to be. We were promised a recovery, and we haven't seen that recovery yet. [boos] When the president took office four years ago, 32 million people were on food stamps. Today 47 million people are on food stamps, 15 million more people. That's more than the population of Ohio have been added to the food stamp rolls. We were supposed to be at 5.4 percent unemployment by now under the president's recovery plan, but instead we stay above 8 percent. And by the way, that difference is not just a couple of percentage points. That difference is 9 million families, 9 million Americans that would have jobs if we had 8 — 5.4 percent unemployment rate. There are today 23 million Americans out of work or stopped looking for work or underemployed. This is a tough time. And even those people that have jobs, middle-income families are struggling, treading water at best, drowning at worst. You see right now that medium income in America has dropped by $4,300 a family, $4,300, even as the cost of health insurance has gone up, food's more expensive, utilities are more expensive, gasoline is doubled. This recovery hasn't happened the way it was supposed to. And the reason we're going to get a new president in November is we're going to have a president who can get this economy going and put people back to work.   AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! MR. ROMNEY: I was — I was surprised that in the president's speech at the Democrat convention, he didn't talk about unemployment. I — I was surprised that he — he didn't lay out a plan to get America working again. Instead, he promoted that — that slogan of theirs, forward. I think forewarned is a better term, all right? [cheers] I mean, if you like what you've seen in the last four years, than you can vote for the same guy, and you're going to see more of it, because if you re-elect President Obama, you're going to see in this nation chronic unemployment, no growth in take-home pay and, of course, fiscal crisis at the doorstep. If you elect me, we're going to get 12 million new jobs and more take-home pay.   I've got a plan, all right? Unlike the president, I have a plan. And my plan will create 12 million new jobs. Let me tell you what it is. I — I put my hand up because there are five parts to it. [laughter] Number one, we're going to get this economy going because we have an ace in the hole we haven't taken advantage of. Some people discovered a number of years ago that you could drill not just vertically into the earth, but vertically and then horizontally. And by doing so — (scattered cheers) — they tapped into pockets of gas and oil. I'm going to make sure we take advantage of our oil, our gas, our coal —   — our nuclear, our renewables. We're going to get North American energy independence.   And that preserves jobs, and it creates jobs, not just in the — in the — in the energy sector, but in manufacturing, because when we have abundant and low-cost energy, manufacturing will come back here. And you say, well, how are going to get North American energy independence? Well, one, I'm going to make sure we drill offshore. I'm going to double the number of permits we give on federal lands and in federal waters. And I'm also going to make sure we drill ANWR. But I'm going to get that pipeline in from Canada, too.   Number two — energy is one; number two: Trade is good for us. We can sell goods around the world and services and compete with anybody. We have the best workers, the most productive workforce in the world. So I want more trade. But I also want you to understand that when nations cheat, when they don't follow the — the rules of fair trade, we're going to call them on the carpet. China's been cheating; we're going to stop it and save and create more American jobs.   China — I mean, this sounds like the kind of stuff they — they talk about in classrooms right — right here at Lake Erie College. But let me tell you, the — the — when a nation holds down the value of their currency, what it does is makes their goods much cheaper than they would otherwise be. And China's currency is held down such that their products are priced well below what they'd be priced if their currency were floating on a market. And as a result of that, their goods are cheaper, and people buy their products, and American companies selling those products go out of business. We can't let that go on year after year after year. It's killing our jobs. And then when they take our patents and our designs and our know-hows and — know-how and they counterfeit our goods, it kills jobs. This cannot go on. I will call China a currency manipulator and stop them in their tracks from killing American jobs.   Number three — number one is energy. Number two is trade. Number three is making sure that our workers have the skills they need for the jobs of today with the right kind of training programs. And we've got to fix our schools. Look, our kids can't have a great future unless our schools are competitive. It's time for us to put the kids — the kids and the parents and the teachers first and the teachers union behind.   Number four, you're not going to get entrepreneurs to go out and start a little enterprise, risk their life savings to start a business, you're not going to get big companies to expand in America unless they realize that we are not headed to Greece. And what you see in this country right now is the spending year-in and year-out, now a trillion dollars more than we take in every year. When the president was sworn in office, we had about a $10 trillion debt. Today we have 16 trillion (dollars). Think of that. All the presidents before him added up to 10 trillion (dollars). In one term he's gotten us to 16 trillion (dollars). There will not be a second term. We can't afford him for a second term.   And number five, to get this economy really going, we have to make sure that we focus on that part of our economy that really creates jobs, and that's small business. I will champion small business and entrepreneurs.   The president wants to raise taxes on small business. I want to bring them down. He puts more regulation on small business. I want to make less regulation on small business. And I want to take that big cloud off of small business. It's killing jobs. I want to get rid of ""Obamacare"" and replace it with something that'll truly reform health care.   This country is going to come roaring back. Let me tell you: You do those five things that we create those 12 million jobs, you're going to see rising take-home pay again. You're going to have young people that come out of colleges like this that can actually get jobs. Today half the kids coming out of college can't find work or college-level work. This is — this is not the American experience, the American dream they planned. The majority of Americans today are convinced that the future is dimmer than the past. That's unacceptable. That's not America. That's not the America we know. What's happening to us is we're becoming Europe as the president makes us more and more like Europe with bigger and bigger government. He doesn't understand that what makes America such an economic powerhouse is the innovative, creative, dynamic spirit of the American people. He thinks government does it. It's people that do it. I will restore this freedom of the American people and get our economy growing by doing it.   I was — I was — I was honored to be able to — to meet the people of America over the past two years and continue to do so, even today, get the chance to say hi to people and learn about their lives. A lot of people have told me how tough things are for them. A lot of folks can't get health insurance; it's too expensive. A lot of people can't afford the kind of life they used to have, can't go to the movies and can't go out to dinner. They just can't afford it anymore. A lot of people having hard times. A lot of folks are ready to really begin to rebuild our economy. I — I meet entrepreneurs of all kinds. I met a woman who has her own business. And I said, how did you get into business? She said, well, my husband lost his job, and he took a class in upholstering. And she said, because I was a better business mind in the family, I decided to start a company. And she did. And she hired him as her first employee. (Laughter, cheers, applause.) And — and then she went on to hire 39 more people. She says she has 40 people who would do upholstering work. And she has a leading upholstery company. That's kind of the entrepreneurship of how this country works. And then — then I met a guy in southern Illinois named Jim Liautaud. I know (sic) whether you know Jim. Jim — Jim graduated second in his class, second from the bottom, in high school. [laughter] And — [chuckles] — and he — he had this idea that because college wasn't likely to be part of his future, he instead went to his dad and said, can I get a loan, because I want to start a — a little restaurant business, hamburgers, hot dogs and the like. His dad agreed. They were going to split the business 50-50. Then Jim went out and started finding out how much it costs to get a hamburger griddle and those rollers that heat up the hot dogs and the hood that takes out the smoke. And he — he found out it cost a lot more money than he had. About the only thing he could do with the money he had was make sandwiches. So he set up some tables and made sandwiches, and then he delivered them to people at work. And now Jimmy John's has 1,500 restaurants and employs 60,00 people, all right?   Now, that's — that's how America works. That — that's individuals that have dreams and that begin enterprises and employ one another of our fellow Americans. That — that's — and now we — that's — that's the model I believe in. That's the model I want to restore. The president believes in having a government put money out into — into companies. He put $90 billion into solar and wind and green energy companies. [boos] He — he's picking winners and losers, or actually, in his case, picking losers, all right? [laughter] I mean, it's not just that they go bankrupt. He doesn't understand that the market, where free people pursuing dreams and working to take their ideas to the marketplace — that's what makes America go, not a government that tries to pick investments and — and — and guide the market for us. Look, I believe in freedom. I believe in the American experience. I believe that when the — the founders of this nation, when they said that we had our rights, they said they did not come from the king or the government; they came from God, and among them —   — and among them were life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We're free in this nation to pursue happiness as we choose. And some extraordinary people have pursued happiness in such a way that they've invented products and started enterprises that employ us. And the right course for America is not to crush them or denigrate them or divide America between those who've been highly successful and those that simply look on success with admiration and hope for themselves and their families. We don't want to divide America; we want to unite America, encourage success, encourage risk-taking, encourage new enterprise. And we'll put America to work.   AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA! MR. ROMNEY: You guys, you are great. Let me tell you, I am so excited about our future. I have to tell you, I am convinced that if we do the things I described — and by the way, I didn't learn those things out of a schoolbook, all right, those five steps. I didn't learn those things talking about them at a meeting. Those are things I have lived by having worked in the private sector for 25 years. I understand how America works.   And I understand how important it is for America to be strong. I know what we have to do in terms of growing our — our principles and values, growing our economy and making sure our military is second to none. I will not cut American military.   I love this country. And you guys do too. I know that your — your being out here today, you're not doing this just because I have a great speech, all right. [laughter] You're doing this because you care very deeply about the country. And I'm just — I just want you to know I love this country too, and it's coming back. The work that you're going to do — I have one thing I want to ask of you. I want you to find one person who voted for Barack Obama — shouldn't be impossible — you know two, you know two already — find one or two of them and make sure they understand that if they want to have better jobs and more take-home pay and a more prosperous future for their kids, they need to get behind this campaign. Help bring people to the polls that will vote for the change in Washington that America deserves.   I'm — we're going to get — we're going to get there. We're going to take a step forward today, even in the rain. We're taking a step forward. We're going to show people we care enough to be out in this rain. We care enough to work hard. We care enough to knock on doors and make calls and get friend to support change, real change that will get America working again. This is the day we're taking a step forward. I'm taking it with you. We're taking back America. We're coming back. We're going to be strong.   We're going to help the American people have a bright future. Our kids are going to love what you do today. Thank you so very much! Thank you!    "
Mitt Romney,9/17/2012,"U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce 33rd Annual Convention in Los Angeles, California",West,"Mitt Romney, Remarks to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce 33rd Annual Convention in Los Angeles, California Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/302777","Thank you. Good to be home. I've got a son here somewhere. There he is. Here's a son over there. [scattered applause] And a grandson, too. Have you got your son there with you? Yeah, my son and grandson. Hi, guys.   It's an honor to be your guest and to speak to you as we begin National Hispanic Heritage Month. I'm also pleased to represent the party of Governor Susana Martinez, Governor Brian Sandoval, Governor Luis Fortuno, Senator Marco Rubio and the Texas Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, Ted Cruz.   These leaders are Republicans for the same reasons as millions of other Hispanics. They see that ours is the party of opportunity, the party that will restore America's prosperity. Now, at our convention a few weeks ago, Governor Martinez described an experience that some of you may find familiar. At the beginning of her political career, she was a Democrat. And her star began to rise. And as it did so, she and her husband got an invitation to go to lunch with a couple Republicans. The words ""Democrat"" and ""Republican"" never came up. Instead, they talked about issues, not about party, such as how do we keep welfare from becoming a barrier to work, and how much government is needed before it becomes burdensome to families and small businesses. When the lunch was over, she turned to her husband and she said this: I'll be darned. We're Republicans. [laughter] I love hearing stories like that. I'd like to hear more often. And I'm convinced that the Republican Party is the rightful home of Hispanic-Americans. But my speech today isn't about my political party. It's about the country we love and the future we want to build. During the course of the campaign, I've traveled across the country. I've seen people who've fallen into poverty, people who are living paycheck to paycheck, people who are tired of being tired. Over 23 million Americans are out of work, underemployed or just have quit looking for jobs. The number of people on food stamps has risen by almost 15 million since President Obama took office. Median household income has fallen four years in a row. Now, seeing such a poor jobs and income picture, the Federal Reserve has announced that it will once again print more money. The Fed knows that this comes with a high cost and risk for the future, but it feels it has no other choice. Our leaders in Washington have failed to produce a real recovery. No one is exempt from the pain of this economy, of course, but the Hispanic community has been particularly hard-hit. While national unemployment is at 8.1 percent, Hispanic unemployment, as you know, is over 10 percent. Over 2 million more Hispanics are living in poverty today than the day President Obama took office. In 2008 candidate Obama promised us a world of limitless hope. What we got instead is a world where hope has painful limits, limits that make it harder to start a business, to grow a business or to find a job. The administration promised us that its policies would have brought unemployment down to 5.4 percent by now. They haven't. Unemployment is still above 8 percent. And the difference between the 5.4 percent they promised and the 8 percent they delivered is 9 million more Americans not working, 9 million. I — I expected that the president, at his convention, would talk about the unemployed and unveil a jobs plan. Astonishingly, he didn't. Now, I have a plan, and my plan for a stronger middle class will create 12 million jobs by the end of my first term, and it will raise take-home pay. My plan is premised on the conviction that it is freedom that drives our economy, that free people creating free enterprises is what creates good jobs with good wages. Government supports the job creators, but it cannot take their place. Now, my plan, as you've heard, has five key steps. First, we'll take advantage of our oil, gas, coal, nuclear and renewables to achieve North American energy independence in eight years. That'll not only give us the affordable, reliable energy we need, it will also create nearly 4 million jobs, and it will bring manufacturing back to our country.   Second, we've got to give our fellow citizens the skills they need for the jobs of today, and we've got to give our kids the education they need for the careers of tomorrow. There are too many of our kids trapped in failing schools. As president, I'll ensure that every child from every background receives a quality education. I'll empower the —   — I'll empower the parents of our low- income and special needs students to choose where their child goes to school. Now, three, we'll make trade work for America by forging new trade agreements with nations that play by the rules. At the same time, we'll crack down on nations that don't. We can jump-start our economy by expanding trade with Latin America, and our nation's 3 million Hispanic-owned businesses will have the most to gain. President Obama has not initiated a single new trade agreement with Latin America. I will. I'll also pursue a comprehensive strategy to confront China's unfair trade practices, and I'll do that from day one.   Now, the president may think that announcing new trade lawsuits less than two months before the election will distract from his record. But American businesses and workers struggling on an uneven playing field know better. If I'd known that all it took to get him to take action was to run an ad citing his inaction on China's cheating, I'd have run one a long time ago. Fourth, we have got to cut the deficit and put America on track to a balanced budget.   I actually believe it's immoral for us to continue to spend more than we take in and to pass our debts on to our kids. And I'd like to spend some time talking about this issue in particular. As businessmen and businesswomen, and as Hispanics, you understand the threat President Obama's spending poses in — for our future. Many Hispanics have sacrificed greatly to help build our country and our economy, and to leave for their children a brighter future. Today those sacrifices are being put at risk by a president who just can't stop spending. The president likes to claim he'll reduce the deficit by $4 trillion. What he doesn't go on to tell you is that he's including in that figure over 1 trillion of spending cuts that have already been put in place, or that he's counting deficit reduction for 12 years. Yeah, that's right. That includes five years after he leaves office, even if he were to be re- elected. Under President Obama, federal spending peaked at 25 percent of the total economy. That's a level not seen since World War II. I propose to bring federal spending back to its historical levels, that around 20 percent of the economy, and cap it there. And I'll pursue a 5 percent cut in nonsecurity discretionary spending on my first day in office. It's time for a president who's committed to cutting spending and balancing the budget. And I know how to do that. I've done it before. We balanced our budget in my business and at the Olympics and every year I was in my state.   I'm going to put the federal government on track to a balanced budget by eliminating programs — eliminating programs that are not absolutely essential and also cutting subsidies for things like Amtrak and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Legal Services Corporation and the National Endowment for the — endowments of the arts and humanities. I — I like some of those things, by the way, but we just can't afford them. In fact, my test for each program is this: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, I'll cut it off.   Now in addition, I'm going to send a number of programs that have been growing uncontrollably fast back to the states, where I'm going to limit their rate of growth to the rate of inflation or, in the case of Medicaid, to inflation plus 1 percent. And finally, I'll look to sharply increase the productivity of Washington by reducing federal government employment by 10 percent through attrition, by combining agencies and departments to reduce the overhead, by cracking down on the $115 billion a year in improper payments in government programs —   — and I'll also align government compensation with that in the private sector. You do those things that I just described and we reduce federal spending by about $500 billion a year by the end of my first term. The president, I'm convinced, has put us on a road to Greece. I'll put us back on a road to a stronger America, one which stops spending more than we take in.   And now number five — and you'll find this of particular interest — to get this economy creating the jobs we need and more take-home pay, we have to champion in this country small business.   Look, I started a business myself. We began with 10 people. Today it employ — employs hundreds of people. Our business was investing to help turn around or grow or to start up other small businesses. Today over a hundred thousand people work at companies that we helped start — companies like, as you heard just a moment ago from Hector, Staples, Bright Horizons, The Sports Authority, Steel Dynamics. Small businesses often grow into large businesses. You probably know this. Two-thirds of American jobs created over the last 15 years were created by small business. Now I know small business, not because I studied it in school, but because I lived small business. And I know that small businesses are being crushed by President Obama's policies. Too often government regulators treat businesses like to the enemy, and they crush them with an avalanche of regulations. Big business can deal with that. Small business can't. And then there are taxes. I met an entrepreneur in the electronics industry in St. Louis. He said that he and his son had gone through a calculation to determine how much they paid to the government in federal income taxes, payroll taxes, state income taxes, gasoline taxes, sales taxes and real estate taxes. It amounted to over half of what their business earned. Over half. Now, you think about that. The likelihood of success in small business is not real high, and if you're lucky enough to be successful, the government wants to take more than half. No wonder business start-ups are at a 30-year low. But the president has announced that he plans to raise the federal income tax on small businesses even more, from 35 percent to 40 percent. That will kill about 700,000 jobs. We need more jobs, not less. And a recent study concluded that my plan, which reduces the tax rate on small business, will instead create 7 million jobs. And now let me talk for a moment about ""Obamacare"" and how it affects jobs. The Chamber of Commerce surveyed 1,300 of its members. It found that three-quarters of them said they're less likely to hire people because of ""Obamacare."" Yeah, I know that we need health care reform, but ""Obamacare"" is the wrong way to go about it. ""Obamacare"" is going to replace consumer choice with government choice, and it would cause health insurance premiums to skyrocket. And it's already depressing job creation. I'm going to repeal ""Obamacare"" and replace it with reforms that increase choice, slow down the runaway growth of insurance costs and that open the doors to more new jobs. Now, by the way —  . Let me note, if we do those five things, if we take advantage of our energy resources in full and we fix our schools and we open more trade and we cut the deficit and we truly champion small business, our economy is going to come roaring back. We can do better than this lackluster economy. We can create 12 million jobs and rising take- home pay again. Now, my confidence, by the way, comes from the entrepreneurs I've met across the country. We're in a room full of hard-working entrepreneurs right here. Martha de la Torre is here. In 1988, Martha co-founded El Clasificado, a Spanish-language weekly. Classified ads; now, there's a tough business. But Martha adapted with the times. She became an expert in search-engine marketing, and she turned Clasificado.com into an online powerhouse. We're joined by another successful entrepreneur, Dorene Dominguez. Dorene oversees one of the nation's top construction management firms. She's been collecting so many awards for leadership this year that we're lucky she didn't have a conflict on her calendar today. [laughter] Now, I happen to believe that entrepreneurs like Martha and Dorene are the future for America. I believe in them. I believe the credit for their work goes to them, not to the government. And I sure don't believe that the government should take more of what they earn away from them. This is really at the heart of the difference between President Obama and my vision for the future of America's economy. He wants government to tax more and regulate more because he believes government can do a better job than you can. I believe in you. I believe you could do a better job than government. I believe —  . I'm confident that you and your dreams and your freedoms will build a stronger future for all of us and for our children. This belief in free people and free enterprises is the American heritage. It's why, by the way, America has outperformed economically every other nation on earth. Now finally, I want to say a word about immigration. Americans may disagree about how to fix our immigration system, but I think we can all agree it's broken. For years Republicans and Democrats seem to have been more interested in playing politics with immigration than with actually fixing it. Candidate Obama said that one of his highest priorities would be to fix immigration in his first year in office. Despite his party having majorities in both houses of Congress, supermajorities, the president never even offered up a bill. Like so many issues confronting our nation, when it comes to immigration, politics have been put ahead of people for far too long. I will work with Republicans and Democrats to permanently fix our immigration system. We'll never achieve a legal immigration system that's fair and efficient if we don't first get control of our borders. I believe we can all agree that what we need are fair and enforceable immigration laws that will stem the flow of illegal immigration while strengthening legal immigration. I want to make this system far more simple and transparent. You shouldn't have to hire lawyers to find out how to legally immigrate into the United States.   And by the way, I want to shift our diversity visas to instead bring together immediate family members, and I want to structure our temporary worker visa programs so that these meet the needs of our employers. And by the way, if someone gets an advanced degree, I want them to stay here. So I'd staple a green card to their diploma.   America's a nation of immigrants, and immigration is essential to our economic growth and prosperity. One million immigrants legally enter America every year, the largest number of any country in the world. I like that. I want to preserve our heritage of robust legal immigration. And I want to make sure that those who abide by the law and wait in line to immigrate here and do so legally are not at a disadvantage. That's why I oppose amnesty because amnesty will make it harder, not easier, to strengthen our legal immigration system. It's also why my administration will establish an employment verification system so that every business can know whether the people it hires are legally eligible for employment. If a business cheats, there will be strict penalties for that business. Now, in the midst of a difficult re-election campaign, President Obama created what he calls a ""stopgap measure"" — those are his words — for children who were brought here illegally, through no fault of their own. Instead of playing politics with these children, I will pursue permanent immigration reform, and I'll start by ensuring that those who serve in our military have the opportunity to become legal permanent residents of the country they fought to defend.   Those who have risked their lives in defense of America have earned the right to make their life in America. Now, I've —   — I've spoken often about how proud I am of my father. He was born to American parents who were living in Mexico. When he was five, they left everything behind and started over again in the United States. My — my dad grew up poor, but he believed in a country where the circumstances of one's birth were not a barrier to achievement, a place where hard work could turn dreams into reality. He went from selling paint out of the trunk of his car to becoming the chief executive of a great car company and ultimately to become the governor of the state of Michigan. My wife, Ann's father, was a first-generation immigrant. He ended up founding a successful manufacturing company that made components and equipment for ships for the United States Navy. I know that many of you in this room have similar stories. That's the American story. It's a story that is told over and over and over again. It's the story of the American dream. The American dream is not gone. It's just been put a little further from reach. I know what it takes to bring it back, to have it inspire our children just as it inspired our fathers and mothers. They sacrificed so much so that we might have it as part of our lives. And now it's our turn, our responsibility to restore the opportunity and prosperity and dreams that have invigorated this nation from its beginning. And it is a responsibility we will fulfill together. Thank you so very much.   An honor to be with you, and God bless you and the United States of America. Thank you.    "
Mitt Romney,9/25/2012,Clinton Global Initiative in New York City,Northeast,"Mitt Romney, Remarks to the Clinton Global Initiative in New York City Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/302775","Thank you, Mr. President. It's an honor to be there this morning, and I appreciate your kind words, and that introduction is very touching. If there's one thing we've learned this election season, by the way, it is that a few words from Bill Clinton can do any man a lot of good. [laughter and applause] All I got to do now is wait a couple of days for that bounce to happen, so — [laughter] — As you know, since — since serving as president, President Clinton has devoted himself to — to lifting people around the world. And one of the best things that can happen to any cause, to any people, is to have Bill Clinton as its advocate. And — and that's — that's really true for a whole series of causes, but particularly for the needy and neglected causes. If — if he gets behind them, it makes a real difference. And it's that kind of work that brings us here together today, and I appreciate your willingness to spend time and to listen to those that are coming with their messages. Now, there are a number of things that impress me about the Global Initiative. And one of them is that, as I've seen it from afar, I've been impressed by the extraordinary power that you have derived by harnessing together people of different backgrounds, institutions of different backgrounds and persuasions. Your — you've able to fashion partnerships, if you will, across the traditional boundaries — public and private, for-profit, not-for-profit, charitable, commercial. At a smaller scale, by the way, I — I've seen the power of partnerships like this work before. In — in Massachusetts, Bill Clinton just spoke about — about City Year. And I have right over here Michael Brown, one of the founders. This was — this was an effort where two social pioneers, Michael and his friend Alan Khazei, brought corporations and government together with volunteers to form this entity. And it was the model, as the president said, for AmeriCorps. And — and I — I actually happened to be there at the first time he visited City Year. He was there investigating the life- changing successes, which were being reported by — in — in the lives of these young people who had come together for a year of service and as they were linked with corporate teams that worked with them. Now, I also saw the power of these kind of partnerships in — in 2002 when I was asked to be the head of the Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City. I saw what could happen when very disparate elements of a community were willing to join together in extraordinary unity, and we were able to overcome challenges that many thought would be impossible for an organization like ours to — to overcome. Now, the Clinton Global Initiative has also demonstrated the effectiveness of entrepreneurship and social enterprise. You endeavor not only to comfort and assuage the pains of the — the afflicted but also to change lives, to change lives through freedom, through — through free enterprise, through entrepreneurship and — and through the incomparable dignity that is associated with work. Free enterprise, as we know, has done more to bless humanity than any other economic system not only because it's the only system that creates a prosperous middle class but also because it's the only system where the individual enjoys the freedom to guide and build his or her life. Free enterprise can not only make us better off financially, it can make us better people. Ours is a very compassionate nation, as you know. We look around the world, and we see withering suffering. Our hearts break. Though we make up only 4.5 percent of the world's population, we donate nearly a quarter of all global foreign aid, more than twice as much as any other nation on earth. And Americans give more than money. Pastors like Rick Warren lead mission trips that send thousands of Americans around the world, bringing aid and comfort to the poorest places on the planet. American troops are the first on the scene of a natural disaster. An earthquake strikes, Haiti in — in Haiti, and care packages come from all over the world, but they come first from America. And not far behind, of course, are Presidents Clinton and Bush. But too often our passion for charity as a people is tempered by our sense that our aid is not always effective. We see stories of cases where American aid has been diverted to corrupt governments. We sometimes wonder why year after year after year of aid and relief seem to never extinguish the suffering and hardship, why it persists decade after decade. Perhaps some of the disappointments are due to our failure to recognize just how much the developing world has changed. A lot of the foreign aid efforts that we put in place some years ago were designed at a time when government development assistance accounted for about 70 percent of the resources flowing to developing nations. Today 82 percent of the resources that flow to developing nations come from the private sector, not the governmental sector. If somehow foreign aid can really leverage that massive investment by the private sector, it may be able to exponentially expand the ability to not only care for those that are suffering but also to change their lives on a permanent basis. Now, private enterprise is — is having a greater and greater impact, actually, on its own in the developing world. As an example, the John Deere company embarked upon a pilot project in Africa where it developed a suite of farm tools that could be attached to a very small tractor, and then the company worked to expand the availability of capital to the farmers there so they could maintain and develop their own businesses. The result has been a good investment for John Deere and a greater opportunity for African farmers who are now able to grow more crops and provide for more plentiful lives of their own. For American foreign aid to become more effective, it's got to embrace the principles that you see in these global initiatives: the power of partnerships, access to the transformative nature of free enterprise and the leverage of the abundant resources that can come from the private sector. Now I believe that there are three quite legitimate objects of our foreign aid in this country. First, of course, is to address humanitarian needs. Such is the case with the PEPFAR, which has given medical treatment to millions suffering from HIV and AIDS. Second is to foster a substantial United States strategic interest. Perhaps it's military or diplomatic or — or economic. But third, there's another purpose, and one that I think has to receive much more attention and a much higher priority in a Romney administration. And that is aid that elevates people and brings about lasting change in communities and nations. As an example, a lot of Americans, including myself, are developed — excuse me — are troubled by developments in the Middle East. Syria has witnessed the killing of tens of thousands of people. The president of Egypt is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. Our ambassador to Libya was assassinated in a terrorist attack. Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons capability. We somehow feel that we're at the mercy of events, rather than shaping events. I'm often asked why, what can we do it — do about it to — to have — lead the Middle East to stability and to ease the suffering and the anger and the — and the hate there and the violence. Obviously religious extremism is certainly part of the problem, but that's not the whole story. The population of the Middle East is very young, as you know, particularly in comparison with the population of the developed nations. And typically, the — these young people, as the president indicated a moment ago, don't have a lot of job prospects. The levels of youth unemployment across the region are excessive and chronic. And in nations that have undergone a change in leadership recently, young people have greater access to information. In the past, that was being carefully guarded by tyrants and dictators, but now it's available. They see the good as well as the bad in surrounding societies. They can now organize across vast regions, mobilizing populations. Idle, humiliated by poverty and crushed by government corruption, their frustration and their anger grows. In such a setting, for America to actually change lives, to change communities and nations in the Middle East, foreign aid must also play a role. And the shape that role should play was brought into focus by the life and death of Mohamed Bouazizi of Tunisia, that street vendor who self-immolated and who sparked, thereby, the Arab Spring. You probably know this background, but it touched me. He was just 26 years old. He had provided for his family since he was a very young boy. He worked a small fruit stand, selling to passers-by. The regular harassment by corrupt bureaucrats was elevated one day when they came in and took cases of his fruit, and then they took away his weighing scales, his only real capital equipment, away from him. On the day of his final protest, witnesses say that an officer slapped him and he cried out with these words: Why are you doing this to me? I'm a simple person. I just want to work. I just want to work. Work. That has to be at the heart of our effort to help people build economies that can create jobs, young and old alike. Work builds self-esteem. It transforms minds from fantasy and fanaticism to reality and grounding. Work does not long tolerate corruption, nor will it quietly endure the brazen theft by government of the product of hard-working men and women. To foster work and enterprise in the Middle East and in other developing countries, I'll initiate something I'll call ""Prosperity Pacts."" Working with the private sector, the program will identify the barriers to investment and trade and entrepreneurship and entrepreneurialism in developing nations. And in exchange for removing those barriers and opening their markets to U.S. investment and trade, developing nations will receive U.S. assistance packages focused on developing the institutions of liberty, the rule of law, and property rights. We'll focus our efforts on small- and medium-size businesses. Microfinance has been an effective tool at promoting enterprise and prosperity, but we — we got to expand to small- and medium-size businesses as well that are oftentimes too large for microfinance and too small for traditional banking. The aim of a much larger share of our aid must be the promotion of work and the fostering of free enterprise. Nothing we can do as a nation will change lives and nations more effectively and permanently than sharing the insight that lies at the foundation of America's own economy, and that is that free people pursuing happiness in their own ways build a strong and prosperous nation. Now, when I was in business, I traveled to a number of other countries. I was often struck by the vast difference in wealth among nations that were sometimes neighbors. Some of that was of course due to geography. Rich countries often had natural resources like mineral deposits or access to waterways for transportation. But in some cases, all that seemed to separate a rich country from a more poor one was a faint line on a map. Countries that were physically right next door to each other were in some cases economically worlds apart. You can think of North Korea and South Korea. I became convinced that the critical difference between these countries wasn't geography. I noticed that the most successful countries shared something in common. They were the freest. They protected the rights of individuals. They enforced the rule of law. They encouraged trade and enterprise. They understood that economic freedom is the only force in history that has consistently lifted people out of poverty and kept people out of poverty. Look, a temporary aid package can — can give an economy a — a boost. It can fund projects. It can pay some bills. It can employ some people for a time. But it can't sustain an economy, not for the long term. It can't pull the whole cart, if you will, because at some point the money runs out. But — but an assistance program that helps unleash free enterprise can create enduring prosperity. Free enterprise is based on mutual exchange, or rather millions of exchanges, millions of people buying, trading, selling, building, investing. Yeah, it has its ups and downs. It isn't perfect. It's more reliable, however, and more durable. And ultimately, as history has shown, it's — it's more successful. By the way, perhaps the best example of — of the good that free enterprise can do is by looking at the example of the developed world itself. My friend Arthur Brooks at the American Enterprise Institute — he's pointed out that before the year 1800, living standards in the West were appalling. A person born in the 18th century lived essentially as his great-great-great-grandfather had. Life was overwhelmed with disease and danger and early death. But starting in 1800, the West began two centuries of free enterprise and trade. Living standards rose. Literacy spread. Health improved. In our own country, between 1820 and 1998 real per capita GDP, real per capital GDP increased twenty-twofold. As the most prosperous nation in history, it's our duty to keep the engine of prosperity running, to open markets across the globe and to spread prosperity to all the corners of the earth. We should do it because it's the right moral course to help others of our brothers and sisters. But it's also economically the smart thing for us to do. In our export industries, the typical job pays above what the comparable workers make in other industries, and more than one-third of manufacturing jobs in this country are tied to exports. Sadly, we've lost over half a million manufacturing jobs over the last four years. As president, I intend to reverse that trend by ensuring we have trade that works for America. I want to negotiate new trade agreements and ask Congress to reinstate Trade Promotion Authority. I want to complete negotiations to expand the Trans-Pacific Partnership and create what I call a ""Reagan Economic Zone,"" where any nation willing to play by the rules of free and fair trade can participate in a new community committed to fair and free trade. I've laid out a new approach for a new era. We're going to couple aid with trade and private investment and partnerships to empower individuals, encourage innovators and reward entrepreneurs. Today we face a world with unprecedented challenges and complexities. We should not forget and cannot forget that not far from here, a voice of unspeakable evil and hatred has spoken out, threatening Israel and the entire civilized world. But we come together knowing that the bitterness of hate is no match for the strength of love. In the weeks ahead I will continue to speak to these challenges and the opportunities that this moment presents us. I'll go beyond foreign assistance and describe also what I believe America's strategy should be to secure our interests and ideals during this uncertain time. A year from now I hope to return to this meeting as president, having made substantial progress towards achieving the reforms I've outlined. But I also hope to remind the world of the goodness and the bigness of the American heart. I'll never apologize for America. I believe that America has been one of the greatest forces for good the world has ever known. We can hold that knowledge in our hearts with humility and unwavering conviction. God bless you and this great work, and God bless my country and yours. Thank you so very much. It's an honor to be with you.    "
Mitt Romney,9/25/2012,NBC Education Nation Summit in New York City,Northeast,"Mitt Romney, Remarks at the NBC Education Nation Summit in New York City Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/315960","Thank you. It's an honor to be here with you and I appreciate the chance that NBC is giving us to come together to talk about a topic as important the education of our children, and also enjoy the chance to see Brian Williams, a — an American hero, a real champion, a man of character and integrity. And it's — it's an honor to be here with him as well. Let me take you back to my own experience and — and I — I'm thinking of my children, my five sons, and the experience that I had in watching their education and participating in it. I was lucky to live in the state of Massachusetts because our state has and had at the time very good schools. As a matter of fact, I was pleased that while was I serving as governor, the NAEP exam, which, as you know, tests our kids every two years — fourth graders, eighth graders — in English and math — the results came back. Our fourth graders came out number one in the nation in English and also number one in math, and our eighth graders came out number one in English and number one in math. So in all four of the federal measures that evaluate the effectiveness of schools, our kids were number one. Had never happened before. And I looked back to understand why our school as had become so successful, and I think it goes back to 1993, when my predecessors, Governor Weld and the leaders of the Democratic house and senate, came together to reform education. And they made a number of changes that I think are what helped drive our schools to be so successful. One, they said, that to graduate from high school, a student was going to have to pass a graduation exam in English and math. And while I was governor, by the way, I added science to that as well. So a graduation exam. Two, they worked on a — a statewide curriculum. It took a number of years to put that together, but they had a series of elements they felt that students needed to learn. Three, they would evaluate annually the success of various schools — all the schools, actually. And if a school consistently fell below a passing grade, then the state had the capacity to step in, take over the school, remove its leadership and actually remove elements of the union contract if they believed those elements interfered with the education of a child. Beyond that, I had the chance not just to have this — if you will, the stick — if you can't pass the graduation exam, you can't graduate; I always worked to put in place the carrot, if you will — an incentive. While I was governor, we were able to pass legislation that said that if you took the exam to graduate and you were among the top quarter in your high school in terms of the grades you got in that exam, then you were entitled to the John and Abigail Adams scholarship, which was four years tuition-free at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning. Now, that's not as generous as you might hope, because in Massachusetts, fees are a lot more than tuition. But it was nonetheless some help and support for young people who were working to get into higher education. We also in that 1993 legislation opened the door to far more choice by offering a massive expansion in charter schools. That went along with our Catholic schools, which had long offered extensive choice in Massachusetts. And perhaps the most important single thing I think from the education reform effort that went on was an increased focus on the teachers, on hiring the very best and brightest we possibly could, promoting them and giving them opportunities to be successful in the classroom. Now, my experience there was — was consistent with something I read as I was serving as governor, because I wanted to find ways to keep our schools as good, at least, as what I — how I found them. And — and I read some work that was done by a group called the McKinsey Institute. McKinsey's a major international consulting firm, but they have a not-for-profit foundation which does research around the world. And they looked at school systems all over the world, compared nations, which ones were successful — Finland, as I recall, Singapore, Korea — South Korea — as well as places within the United States that were successful. And they looked at the Boston school system, for instance, and looked at all the differences between school districts and systems. And they came to this conclusion. They said first of all, within a normal band of population, that the classroom size didn't seem to be driving the quality of education; that obviously, at some extreme, that would figure into it, be a major impact, but within the normal range that exists in schools, it wasn't classroom size that was driving it. Nor was it spending per student. They were surprised by both those things as they looked around the world. Their conclusion was that overwhelmingly the greatest determination --or determiner of the success of a school system was the quality of the teachers in the system, and that the very best nations and districts in terms of education were those that found a way to attract the best and brightest to come into education. They pointed out, as I recall, that in Finland, I think it was, that the teachers were drawn from the top 5 or 10 percent of college graduates. And they pointed out that too often in our country, we're not drawing from the very top. And they tried to understand why that was and pointed out that in other nations, that drew from the very top, they had better starting salaries for teachers, and they promoted teachers based on their capacity and their skill, the ability they had to change lives in classrooms, as opposed to their tenure alone. They looked at our schools and felt that we were too — too focused on pensions and post-retirement benefits and tenure, and not sufficiently focused on starting salaries and helping people get going in their life. If they got a lot of student loans, they need those starting salaries to get going and also a system which promotes teachers based upon their success in the classroom. I look at the federal level and understand that as — if I'm the next president of the United States, as I hope to be, that I — I don't want to step in and try and run schools for local school districts or for states. Education is largely run at the state level. But I — I do believe that there is action I can take at the federal level that will have an impact on improving the quality of education, and it flows from my experience both as governor and from the experience of — of those that have studied education, such as the McKinsey Institute. And the proposals that I have are — are these. First of all, I would take IDEA and Title I money — and as you know, those are the federal funds that go to follow both special needs kids and low-income kids, and that's about half the kids in America — receive federal funding from those two sources, one or the other of those two sources — I would link that money not to the school districts or to the state but to the students and say to the student, you can take that money to the school of your choice. So you and your parents can decide what school you want to go to. And that of course will drive a very different level of school choice than we have today. To help the parents make the choice of which school to send their child to, I would insist that schools are graded on a simple basis that parents could understand, A through F, the way Florida's done. Florida's actually done quite a job in saying, how we can we evaluate the success of schools and then give to — to students the opportunity to make the choice of which they'd like to go to. I — I'm impressed with — I mean, you know some of the statistics from — from Florida. Some have said, well, it's going to be hard for Hispanic students to — to be able to keep up with the rest of the population. Not so. In Florida, by virtue of those two changes, if you had a state that was just comprised of the Hispanic students of Florida, why, that state would fall right in the middle, about rank number 25 of American states. And that's been in part because of these extraordinary improvements that have been brought into the — to the — to the school system in — in Florida. So those are two things I would do at the federal level — give students more choice, allow parents to have access to information about the quality of the schools. And I'd also like to make sure that we create incentives for school districts and for states to offer more choice in schools, to take away the barriers to charter schools, to take away the barriers to cyberlearning, to allow students to choose public schools, public charter schools where it's allowed by law, private schools or cyberlearning or even tutorial-type sessions. I want to provide incentive at the federal level to encourage states to encourage new choice and new information for our parents. Let me just make a comment about higher education, as well. Higher education is also essential to the success of our economy and to the well-being of so many of our fellow citizens. And we have excellent institutions of higher learning. I mean, it's — we're a model for the world. But one trend in higher education gives me great concern, and that's the rapid growth in the cost of tuition, the cost of higher education. And we're on an unsustainable path there. You can't continue to have higher-education tuition grow at a multiple of the rate of inflation. At some point, something has to give. And we're going to have to find a solution to that challenge. I have ideas myself in that regard, but I do believe that this is something that just — just can't go on. And related to that is the fact that people coming out of institutions of higher learning can't find jobs. And the combination of more and more expensive tuition and fewer and fewer job opportunities, this last year with half of our kids graduating without being able to have a full-time job or one consistent with their degree, that's a real problem. And — and those two combined must end, or we're going to have a real threat to our higher education system. So I — I applaud the chance to be able to speak with you today, your willingness to be here. I am — I'm absolutely convinced that enough — for us to maintain our leadership of the world economically, morally, militarily, diplomatically, that America must have the best schools in the world. And today with our kids performing in the bottom third or bottom quartile in science and math, that's simply not the case. And I think we know the answer as to what it takes to fix our schools is to invest in great teachers. Teachers are the answer. Thank you.    "
Mitt Romney,9/27/2012,"Sprinfield Veternas for Romney Event in Springfield, Virginia",South,"Mitt Romney, Remarks at a Springfield Veterans for Romney Event in Springfield, Virginia Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/316000","Thank you. Wow, what a group here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so very much. What an honor to be here with you today. Thank you.   Members of the American Legion, thank you. Thank you for your service. A real honor. Please, please. Secretary Nicholson, thank you for that generous introduction — a Marine, a veteran of — of Vietnam and our conflict there. Appreciate his leadership in our country and his commitment to veterans. He was kind to be here today and to — to welcome me. Thank you also to Colonel Leo Thorsness, Medal of Honor recipient. Colonel Thorsness, would you stand and be recognized here?   We appreciate your being here today, sir. Thank you. Thank you.   You perhaps know Colonel Thorsness served in Vietnam, was a prisoner of war for six years there. He has — has led the Association of Medal of Honor Recipients and he has been kind enough to help organize many of them for me. Some 42 of them have joined my effort, endorsed my campaign. And I appreciate your service in this campaign, but even more, I appreciate your service for our — to our country and for our country. I — in listening to Secretary Nicholson, I recalled some of those experiences of sending off our men and women in uniform to go off and — into Iraq and Afghanistan. There was one in particular that stands out, and this was a — a ceremony where quite a large number of men and women were on their way out. The families were behind them in the — in the bleachers, and the soldiers were seated in front. And their commanding officer spoke, and I spoke. And at one point after we were finished a hand went up. And — and I recognized the person who raised his hand, and he said, I have a young lady that I'm in love with, and we haven't been married, and I'm going to go off to conflict. Could you marry us? [laughter] And I said, I don't see why not — [laughter] — and called the two of them forward, in front of the entire audience, brought them up and pronounced a wedding ceremony. I figured I was the governor; I could do whatever the heck I wanted to. [laughter] And so — [chuckles] — so I married these two, and when I got back to the office, they said, you know, there's this thing called a marriage license. Did you know about that, Governor? [laughter] And — [chuckles] — we were able to take care of all those things and make sure that it was legitimate. But what a — what a privilege to be able to be there and to send off men and women who love their country. I am — I'm privileged today in the presence of those who have served their nation, who, in the words of that wonderful hymn, ""O beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife, who more than self their country loved and mercy more than life.""   I — I had also an honor last night. I was in Toledo, Ohio, and was leaving from Toledo to come here, and at the airport there was an Honor Flight returning to Toledo. And so, wanting to see those veterans, I parked myself over by their aircraft. And as they began coming down the — the — the plane — so it wasn't actually steps, but a kind of a gangway kind of thing. They came walking down, and I was able to shake hands with a number of them and say hello. And — and then towards the end, the wheelchair brigade came along, because those that walked came out first, and then the wheelchairs later. And — and there were — the last couple were — were the most difficult, I — I think, physically to be able to leave the aircraft. The — the second to the last individual stands out in my mind. He was brought down, quite elderly, a second world war veteran. And apparently, they had some difficulty just arranging the wheelchair of the aircraft and getting him in it and bringing it down this long gangway. And finally, he came down and I — I — I said hello to him and shook his hand. And then he turned to — to go through this long alleyway that had been set up of flags and people who were there to recognize each of the veterans. But he stopped the person who was pushing them — pushing him in the wheelchair. And then he reached inside his coat and took out a flag — AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Aww. MR. ROMNEY: — and waved it. And we all applauded.   The love of country, the patriotism that's felt by those who served our country is something which inspires all of us to this day. And I appreciate the service of each of the men and women in this room who've served our nation in uniform and appreciate those who are serving our nation today and those who've served in the past all over this great country. Now I'm concerned about the future. I'm concerned about America. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah. MR. ROMNEY: I'm concerned about the direction America's headed. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right. MR. ROMNEY: The — the White House proposed a sequestration, kind of a gun-to-your-head opportunity, which is if Congress couldn't get the job done properly and the president couldn't lead them, why, they'd make devastating cuts to our military. It's a strange proposal in the first place. It's even stranger that it's being put in place. As Secretary Nicholson indicated, the impact will — will be immediate and significant right here in Virginia. A hundred and thirty-six thousand jobs will be lost in Virginia as a result of this move. But when the secretary of defense said it would be devastating, he wasn't referring merely to the loss of jobs in Virginia or any other state, for that matter. He was thinking about our national security priorities and needs. The world is not a safe place. It remains dangerous. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right. MR. ROMNEY: Look around the world. Look in — look in North Korea. They continue to develop and — and promote nuclear capability on their own part and to export it to others. Syria — 20(,0000), 30,000 people killed in Syria. Iran, closer and closer to having nuclear capability. Egypt, now with a Muslim Brotherhood president. Pakistan, highly tumultuous. Afghanistan — our men and women still in Afghanistan. You — I mean, you keep going around the world. It is still a troubled and dangerous world, and the idea of cutting our military commitment by a trillion dollars over this decade is unthinkable and devastating. And when I become president of the United States, we will stop it. I will not cut our commitment to our military.   Now, you know — you know that these trillion-dollar cuts, both in budget and in sequestration, will have a significant impact on the veterans' system as well, as the secretary just indicated. We already have extraordinary backlogs, a million people backlogged for disability claims. A million people. I understand that they had so many claims piled up in one building here in Virginia that the building became structurally unsound and they had to get the people out of it. [laughter] I mean this — how can this be? And we have huge numbers of our men and women that are returning from conflict that are seeking counseling, psychological counseling, and can't find that counseling within our system, and of course record numbers of suicides. This is a crisis. And in this kind of circumstance, given the challenges and threats around the world, given the need for employment here and given the need of our veterans, how in the world, as commander in chief, you could stand by as we shrink our military commitment financially is something I don't understand, and I will reverse it.   Now, I know there's waste in the military. I'm sure there's opportunity to economize and do a better job with the funds we have, and I expect to go after the Department of Defense and look in every single corner and see if we can't do things in a more efficient way than we've done them in the past. That being said, I want to take the resources we save and use them to make sure we care for our veterans in the way they deserve to be cared for, and that we also rebuild our technological capabilities, including our cyber capabilities, but also our ships and aircraft. Do you realize we have fewer ships in the Navy than anytime since 1917? Now down to the 280s — we were told the minimum number of ships we needed was 313. And the ship number's going to keep coming down unless we recommit to rebuilding our modern Navy. Our Air Force is older and smaller than anytime since 1947, when it was formed. This is unacceptable. And the idea of shrinking our active-duty personnel by 1(00,000) or 200,000 — I want to add a hundred thousand to active-duty personnel.   I happen to subscribe to Ronald Reagan's maxim that peace comes through strength. I want to have a military that's so strong, no one wants to test it — [inaudible].   And there's a long-term threat to our military capability and to our national security, and it relates to something that fuels and builds our military, and that's our economy. You have to have a strong economy in order to build a strong military. Russia tried for a while — the old Soviet Union tried for a while to maintain a grade A, if you will, military, but they had a grade B economy, and they couldn't keep up. They finally had to — well, they collapsed. We have to have a strong economy. Right now Russia's economy is growing at about 4 percent per year. That's their GDP growth. Ours was just revised last quarter down to 1.3 percent per year, about a quarter or a fifth the rate of — of Russia's. This is — this is a real challenge for us. And this is not just one quarter. This has been going on now for years. China's growing much faster than we. Russia's growing faster than we. Our economy needs to be reinvigorated. And the president has laid out his plan. It's a continuation of the old plan. [boos] We can't afford four more years of the last four years. [boos] All right?   It — his plan cuts the military. His plan asks for another stimulus. How'd that last one work, by the way? [laughter] His plan calls for government being able to invest in winners and losers or, in their case, losers. And — [laughter] — and his plan also calls for trillion-dollar deficits. Recognize trillion-dollar deficits — that debt is owned by somebody. Someone holds that. That puts America in a position of — of economic risk, fiscal risk. Do you know how much money is spent on interest every year? By the way, interest rates are real low. And one of the reasons they're so low is that as the government goes out to get — to borrow money, the Federal Reserve takes it and just puts it in their pockets. So we're — in effect, we're manufacturing money. So we keep the interest rates real low. Even with the interest rates real low, we spend more on interest as taxpayers, paying the government debt, than we spend on housing, agriculture, education and transportation combined. It's huge. And it's going to get a lot bigger, particularly if every year we add another trillion dollars to the deficit. This is a — this is an extraordinary challenge that faces America's economy and America's military long term and our foreign policy. I've heard time and again from former members or — excuse me — from former secretaries of state that our diplomatic power and our military power flows from our economic power. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right. MR. ROMNEY: With our economy struggling, that is a long-term trend which is unacceptable to America. Now I have a very different approach. I have five things I'm going to do to get this economy going. And they're going to create 12 million jobs. I'm not going to be cutting jobs from Virginia, I'm going to be adding jobs to Virginia.   So we're going to — and those — those things include, number one, taking advantage of our energy resources — our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables —   — getting North America energy independent. That will keep our gasoline prices more moderate. It will also provide us with a lot of jobs in the energy sector and in manufacturing because when energy is less expensive, manufacturing will come home. That's number one. Number two, I like trade. I want to make sure that we open up new markets for us to trade and sell our goods into around the world. But when nations cheat in trade — and China has cheated — I will finally do something the president has not been willing to do, which is call them on the carpet for it and label them currency manipulators.   That's number two. First, energy; second, trade. Number three, we got to make sure that our people have the skills they need to succeed, so training programs for our adults have to be updated and modernized and linked with what employers need. And we also have to make sure our schools are giving our kids the skills they need. It's unacceptable, in my view, for the nation that invented public education to have kids performing now in the bottom third or bottom quartile of the world. That can't happen. And I know what we have to do. We have to make sure we put the interest of the kids and the parents and the teachers first, and the teachers' union is going to have to go behind.   Number four — number four, you know, we can't keep on spending and borrowing, spending more than we have. We keep doing that year after year after year, you put America on track to becoming Greece or Italy or Spain. We're becoming weaker and weaker, fundamentally, economically. And nations around the world are looking and seeing what we're doing, surprised that we're not willing to take action. If I become president, I will make it my priority in my first hundred days to take action to get America on track to getting a balanced budget. We've got to do it.   And number five, number five, we have to champion small business. We have to make it easier for small businesses to grow and thrive.   That's where about — about two-thirds of the jobs created in America over the last 15 years were created by small business. I want small businesses to grow and — and be able to hire more people and, by the way, to pay higher wages. Do you realize over the last four years the median income in America has dropped every single year? So not only are there 23 million people struggling to find a good job and half our college kids not able to find work or work consistent with a college degree, but incomes are going down. At the same time, food prices are up; electric prices are up; gasoline prices have doubled. These are tough times for the American people. And the answer to help the American people is to get small business growing again, hiring people again, raising wages again.   I know how to do it. We're going to do that. Now, and as the secretary said, my plans include pro-growth tax policies, regulatory policies that encourage small business. And by the way, I want to take this big cloud off of small business that's keeping about three-quarters of them from hiring people, and that is I got to get rid of ""Obamacare"" and replace it with something that works.   So two — two very different paths. One is the path the president's proposed, which is the status quo. His is the path of — well, he calls it ""Forward."" I call it ""forewarned,"" all right? [laughter] All right? It is the same series of policies he's put in place over the last four years, and they have not worked. And — and if you don't — don't believe me, why, look at the price of gasoline, and — and — and look at the — the jobs in your community and the — the members of your family that are struggling for good work. If you don't believe me, look at the numbers that just came out and the growth of our economy: 1.3 percent versus Russia at 4 percent? China at 7 (percent) to 8 percent? We're at 1.3 percent. This is — this is unacceptable. It is not working. I know what it takes to get us working. He's put us on a road to Europe. Europe doesn't work in Europe, all right? [laughter] I want to get us back to being America, where people here come here, build enterprises here, we fulfill American dreams and we keep the hope alive in America.   And this matters. You know this matters. This counts. It counts for the 23 million people who are struggling to get a job or get a better job today. It counts for the young people coming out of school hoping to get a job when they come out of school, and one that will help them pay back their student loans. It counts for the coming generations. We have always been a nation that has recognized that the future is brighter than the past. Today we wonder whether that's true, but the majority of Americans don't think that's the case. This matters. And there's one more sense in which it matters, and it's what I began with, and that is our military capability, our ability to defend our liberty and the liberty of our friends around the world with whom we trade and whose prosperity is linked with our prosperity. I was — I was in Poland a few weeks ago, and I got the chance — chance to meet Lech Walesa, also a hero. And —   — I came in and he said, Mr. Romney, you've just come from the United States. He said, you must be tired. You sit. I'll talk. You listen. [laughter] And so I did. And — and then he said this. For about 15 minutes he said this and repeated it again and again: Where's American leadership? We need American leadership. Where's American leadership? And then he'd talk about a — a region of the world and what was happening in that region, and then he'd say, where's American leadership? And then he'd go to another region, talk about the challenges there. Where's American leadership? Look, the world has always looked to us as that shining city on a hill, but that light looks a little dimmer in some people's minds these days, in part because we haven't been willing to deal with the challenges we have. We keep kicking them down the road and hoping that — that somehow somebody else will deal with it. Well, that time is now ours. This is the greatest generation, that left us this nation so prosperous and so free. Now it's our turn. They've held the torch aloft for the whole world to see, a torch of freedom and opportunity and hope. But they're getting fewer and further between, the greatest generation. They can't hold the torch quite as high as they used to. And so it's our turn to grab that torch and to hold it aloft for the world to see. And if I become president — no, when I become president, as I say —   — we're going to do what has to do — what we have to do. We're going to do what we have to do to get that torch high and very, very bright indeed. We're going to make sure and restore the principles this nation was built upon of freedom and opportunity. We're going to make sure and restore our economy and put people back to work, get rising take-home pay again, and we're going to make sure we have a military that is second to none. I will do those things. I look forward to being the commander in chief, to being able to keep this nation strong. I make that commitment to you.   I need your help. We've got to win in Virginia. I need your help to get the veterans here. We'll keep America the hope of the earth. Thank you so very much. Thank you.    "

I heard that the Colorado CPAC was meeting, and we didn't have this planned, but decided to stop by just to say hello. When I heard my boys were going to be here, I couldn't resist.   I want to thank you for the work you're doing. I know how important it is. I know this is going to be a close-fought battle. We need to win Colorado. If we do, you know what? We're going to take back the White House.   I finally — I finally got here. It was fun to be here and to feel all the energy that you have here. I know of your enthusiasm, I know of your passion for America.   [inaudible] — for the path for prosperity and peace, but for that to happen, you guys are going to have to cheer here and then go out and knock on doors and get people who voted for President Obama to see the light, come join our team. And if you do that, why — why, we'll all be able to come together and have a wonderful inauguration celebration in January.   Now, you know, last night, I thought it was a great opportunity for the American people to see two very different visions for the countryAnd I — I think it was — it was helpful to be able to describe those visions. I — I saw the president's vision as trickle-down government, and I don't think that's what American believes in. I — I — I see instead, a prosperity that comes through freedom. [cheers] And we have two very different courses for America — trickle-down government or prosperity through freedom. And trickle-down government that the president proposes is one where — where he will raises taxes on small business, which will kill jobs. I instead want to keep taxes down on small business so we can create jobs. This is about good jobs for the American people.   If — if we continue down his path, there's no question but the middle class — which the vice president noted has been buried — [laughter] — will continue to be buried with higher and higher expenses for gasoline, for food, for utilities, for health insurance. If I'm elected instead, we're going to see prices moderated because we're going to have people have higher incomes again, we're going to have rising incomes in America because we're going to have more jobs. We're going to have a stronger America with more jobs, rising incomes, moderated prices — that's a very different path than one with trickle-down government. Now, there's another place there's difference, and that's with regards to energy prices. Under trickle-down government, you have the president saying that — well, you remember in his last campaign — that under his policies in energy the prices would necessarily skyrocket. Well, I believe that in alternative we should have North American energy independence, use the energy we have; it'll create jobs, keep our costs down and — (inaudible, cheers, applause) — with our economy.   And — and you heard — you heard the president last night describe how he plans on reducing the deficit. He said it was $4 trillion. But only in Washington would you count $4 trillion of reduction when in fact his plan calls for adding a trillion dollars of debt every one of the next four years. [boos] The Congressional Budget Office says by that the end of a four-year period, if he were to be reelected, trickle-down government would lead to a setting where we would have $20 trillion in debt. I think that's wrong. I think we should instead take a course represented by freedom which says we're going to finally get America to cap our spending, to cut our spending and get us on track to a balanced budget.   It's — it's not often, I'm told, that Republicans are able to go out and talk about Medicare with such passion, as we do. But let me tell you: When someone is taking $716 billion away from our current seniors in their Medicare plan to pay for ""Obamacare"" we say, no way. We're going to put it back and we're going to get rid of ""Obamacare.""   And then — and then there's for the military. The president has proposed cutting our military budget, and then this sequestration idea that came out of the White House — [booing] — cuts our military budget even more. We're looking at about a trillion dollars in cuts. The secretary of defense has said that those cuts would be devastating to our military. Can you imagine allowing cuts of that nature to proceed, as this president seems to be willing to do? If I'm president, we will restore the strength of American military; we will not cut the — (inaudible, cheers, applause) — in my budget.   Now, you know — you know how important is this. Trickle-down government will not create the jobs Americans need. Trickle-down government will not bring down the cost of energy. Trickle-down government will not allow incomes to rise. Freedom is what drives America's economy.   Free people pursuing their dreams, economic freedom —   — and we're bringing it back. And — and the consequence for doing it right versus doing it wrong is really extraordinary. This — this is about the 23 million people in this country that are out of work or stopped looking for work or just given up. This is about the one out of six people that have fallen into poverty. It's about the 47 million people that are on food stamps. We — we don't measure compassion by how many people we can put on food stamps; we measure compassion by how many people we can get a good job — (inaudible, cheers, applause.) So this is about — this is about those 23 million people. It's about the next generation. For the first time in history, Americans believe the future's not as bright as the past and that their kinds won't enjoy the kind of prosperity that they've enjoyed. Well, that would happen, I'm afraid, if President Obama were reelected. It will not happen when I become the next president.   And it's — and it's — [inaudible]   — of the world, as well. And I — I think you understand this. I — I've been fond over the last few weeks of describing my trip to Poland a few weeks ago, when I got the chance to meet with a world hero, Lech Walesa.   Champion of freedom. I came in to see him, by the way, and he — he met me graciously, shook my hand and said, you must be tired; you've come from America. You sit, I'll talk, you listen. [laughter] So I did. I sat down and he began to speak. And over a period of about 15 minutes, he repeated these words time and time again: Where is American leadership? We need American leadership.   We need American lead. I mean, he described an area of the world, the Middle East or other parts of the world, and he's — after — after each area and the tumult in that area, he'd say, where's American leadership? You are the only superpower on the planet. We need America to lead. And American leadership begins with strong values and principles in our homes and communities.   It — [inaudible] — economy. That's why we're spending so much time talking about our economy, because everything we do diplomatically, culturally, militarily, flows from having a strong economy. And so we must rekindle the American economy. These last three years, this has not been a real recovery. Oh, it bumps up, it bumps down, you're going to see ups and downs over the coming months I'm sure. But this is not the trend you want to see. So far this year, America's economy is growing more slowly than last year. And last year, it grew more slowly than the year before. This is not the recovery we need. The Federal Reserve, bringing more money, doing everything that they can, trying to prop this things up. We need to rekindle the strong economy. If America's going to have that last builder of our strength, which is the strong military, I will not cut our military. It will be second to none. It'll be so strong —   — [inaudible]. The people last night were given a choice. They were given a choice between two different visions for America: one where we continue down the road to become more and more like Europe, where a government gets larger and larger, more and more intrusive in our lives, spending more and more, borrowing more and more, putting us on a road to Greece. And the other is a path that returns America to America; where we restore the principles of freedom and hope and opportunity that this nation has always been built upon. I will take us there, with your help. We're going to take back this country — (inaudible, cheers, applause.) Thank you so much. (Inaudible, cheers, applause.)  "
Mitt Romney,10/8/2012,"Foreign Policy at the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia",South,"Mitt Romney, Remarks on Foreign Policy at the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia: ""The Mantle of Leadership"" Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/303089","I particularly appreciate the introduction from my good friend and tireless campaign companion, Gov. Bob McDonnell.  He is showing what conservative leadership can do to build a stronger economy.  Thank you also Congressman Goodlatte for joining us today. And particular thanks to Gen. Peay. I appreciate your invitation to be with you today at the Virginia Military Institute.  It is a great privilege to be here at an Institution that has done so much for our nation, both in war and in peace. For more than 170 years, VMI has done more than educate students.  It has guided their transformation into citizens, and warriors, and leaders.  VMI graduates have served with honor in our nation's defense, just as many are doing today in Afghanistan and other lands.  Since the September 11th attacks, many of VMI's sons and daughters have defended America, and I mourn with you the 15 brave souls who have been lost. I join you in praying for the many VMI graduates and all Americans who are now serving in harm's way.  May God bless all who serve, and all who have served. Of all the VMI graduates, none is more distinguished than George Marshall—the Chief of Staff of the Army who became Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, who helped to vanquish fascism and then planned Europe's rescue from despair. His commitment to peace was born of his direct knowledge of the awful costs and consequences of war. General Marshall once said, ""The only way human beings can win a war is to prevent it.""  Those words were true in his time—and they still echo in ours. Last month, our nation was attacked again.  A U.S. Ambassador and three of our fellow Americans are dead—murdered in Benghazi, Libya.  Among the dead were three veterans.  All of them were fine men, on a mission of peace and friendship to a nation that dearly longs for both.  President Obama has said that Ambassador Chris Stevens and his colleagues represented the best of America.  And he is right.  We all mourn their loss. The attacks against us in Libya were not an isolated incident.  They were accompanied by anti-American riots in nearly two dozen other countries, mostly in the Middle East, but also in Africa and Asia.  Our embassies have been attacked.  Our flag has been burned.  Many of our citizens have been threatened and driven from their overseas homes by vicious mobs, shouting ""Death to America."" These mobs hoisted the black banner of Islamic extremism over American embassies on the anniversary of the September 11th attacks. As the dust settles, as the murdered are buried, Americans are asking how this happened, how the threats we face have grown so much worse, and what this calls on America to do.  These are the right questions.  And I have come here today to offer a larger perspective on these tragic recent events—and to share with you, and all Americans, my vision for a freer, more prosperous, and more peaceful world.  The attacks on America last month should not be seen as random acts.  They are expressions of a larger struggle that is playing out across the broader Middle East—a region that is now in the midst of the most profound upheaval in a century.  And the fault lines of this struggle can be seen clearly in Benghazi itself. The attack on our Consulate in Benghazi on September 11th, 2012 was likely the work of forces affiliated with those that attacked our homeland on September 11th, 2001. This latest assault cannot be blamed on a reprehensible video insulting Islam, despite the Administration's attempts to convince us of that for so long.  No, as the Administration has finally conceded, these attacks were the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on others, especially women and girls; who are fighting to control much of the Middle East today; and who seek to wage perpetual war on the West.  We saw all of this in Benghazi last month—but we also saw something else, something hopeful.  After the attack on our Consulate, tens of thousands of Libyans, most of them young people, held a massive protest in Benghazi against the very extremists who murdered our people.  They waved signs that read, ""The Ambassador was Libya's friend"" and ""Libya is sorry."" They chanted ""No to militias.""  They marched, unarmed, to the terrorist compound.  Then they burned it to the ground.  As one Libyan woman said, ""We are not going to go from darkness to darkness."" This is the struggle that is now shaking the entire Middle East to its foundation.  It is the struggle of millions and millions of people—men and women, young and old, Muslims, Christians and non-believers—all of whom have had enough of the darkness.  It is a struggle for the dignity that comes with freedom, and opportunity, and the right to live under laws of our own making.  It is a struggle that has unfolded under green banners in the streets of Iran, in the public squares of Tunisia and Egypt and Yemen, and in the fights for liberty in Iraq, and Afghanistan, and Libya, and now Syria.  In short, it is a struggle between liberty and tyranny, justice and oppression, hope and despair. We have seen this struggle before.  It would be familiar to George Marshall.  In his time, in the ashes of world war, another critical part of the world was torn between democracy and despotism.  Fortunately, we had leaders of courage and vision, both Republicans and Democrats, who knew that America had to support friends who shared our values, and prevent today's crises from becoming tomorrow's conflicts. Statesmen like Marshall rallied our nation to rise to its responsibilities as the leader of the free world.  We helped our friends to build and sustain free societies and free markets.  We defended our friends, and ourselves, from our common enemies.  We led.  And though the path was long and uncertain, the thought of war in Europe is as inconceivable today as it seemed inevitable in the last century. This is what makes America exceptional:  It is not just the character of our country—it is the record of our accomplishments.  America has a proud history of strong, confident, principled global leadership—a history that has been written by patriots of both parties.  That is America at its best.  And it is the standard by which we measure every President, as well as anyone who wishes to be President. Unfortunately, this President's policies have not been equal to our best examples of world leadership.  And nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East.  I want to be very clear:  The blame for the murder of our people in Libya, and the attacks on our embassies in so many other countries, lies solely with those who carried them out—no one else.  But it is the responsibility of our President to use America's great power to shape history—not to lead from behind, leaving our destiny at the mercy of events.  Unfortunately, that is exactly where we find ourselves in the Middle East under President Obama. The relationship between the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Israel, our closest ally in the region, has suffered great strains. The President explicitly stated that his goal was to put ""daylight"" between the United States and Israel.  And he has succeeded.  This is a dangerous situation that has set back the hope of peace in the Middle East and emboldened our mutual adversaries, especially Iran. Iran today has never been closer to a nuclear weapons capability.  It has never posed a greater danger to our friends, our allies, and to us.  And it has never acted less deterred by America, as was made clear last year when Iranian agents plotted to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador in our nation's capital.  And yet, when millions of Iranians took to the streets in June of 2009, when they demanded freedom from a cruel regime that threatens the world, when they cried out, ""Are you with us, or are you with them?""—the American President was silent. Across the greater Middle East, as the joy born from the downfall of dictators has given way to the painstaking work of building capable security forces, and growing economies, and developing democratic institutions, the President has failed to offer the tangible support that our partners want and need.  In Iraq, the costly gains made by our troops are being eroded by rising violence, a resurgent Al-Qaeda, the weakening of democracy in Baghdad, and the rising influence of Iran. And yet, America's ability to influence events for the better in Iraq has been undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence. The President tried—and failed—to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown that would have better secured our gains. The President has failed to lead in Syria, where more than 30,000 men, women, and children have been massacred by the Assad regime over the past 20 months. Violent extremists are flowing into the fight.  Our ally Turkey has been attacked.  And the conflict threatens stability in the region. America can take pride in the blows that our military and intelligence professionals have inflicted on Al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, including the killing of Osama bin Laden.  These are real achievements won at a high cost.  But Al-Qaeda remains a strong force in Yemen and Somalia, in Libya and other parts of North Africa, in Iraq, and now in Syria. And other extremists have gained ground across the region.  Drones and the modern instruments of war are important tools in our fight, but they are no substitute for a national security strategy for the Middle East. The President is fond of saying that ""The tide of war is receding.""  And I want to believe him as much as anyone.  But when we look at the Middle East today—with Iran closer than ever to nuclear weapons capability, with the conflict in Syria threating to destabilize the region, with violent extremists on the march, and with an American Ambassador and three others dead likely at the hands of Al-Qaeda affiliates— it is clear that the risk of conflict in the region is higher now than when the President took office. I know the President hopes for a safer, freer, and a more prosperous Middle East allied with the United States. I share this hope.  But hope is not a strategy.  We cannot support our friends and defeat our enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds, when our defense spending is being arbitrarily and deeply cut, when we have no trade agenda to speak of, and the perception of our strategy is not one of partnership, but of passivity.  The greater tragedy of it all is that we are missing an historic opportunity to win new friends who share our values in the Middle East—friends who are fighting for their own futures against the very same violent extremists, and evil tyrants, and angry mobs who seek to harm us.  Unfortunately, so many of these people who could be our friends feel that our President is indifferent to their quest for freedom and dignity. As one Syrian woman put it, ""We will not forget that you forgot about us."" It is time to change course in the Middle East.  That course should be organized around these bedrock principles:  America must have confidence in our cause, clarity in our purpose and resolve in our might. No friend of America will question our commitment to support them... no enemy that attacks America will question our resolve to defeat them... and no one anywhere, friend or foe, will doubt America's capability to back up our words. I will put the leaders of Iran on notice that the United States and our friends and allies will prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons capability. I will not hesitate to impose new sanctions on Iran, and will tighten the sanctions we currently have. I will restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf region—and work with Israel to increase our military assistance and coordination.  For the sake of peace, we must make clear to Iran through actions—not just words—that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated. I will reaffirm our historic ties to Israel and our abiding commitment to its security—the world must never see any daylight between our two nations. I will deepen our critical cooperation with our partners in the Gulf. And I will roll back President Obama's deep and arbitrary cuts to our national defense that would devastate our military. I will make the critical defense investments that we need to remain secure.  The decisions we make today will determine our ability to protect America tomorrow.  The first purpose of a strong military is to prevent war. The size of our Navy is at levels not seen since 1916. I will restore our Navy to the size needed to fulfill our missions by building 15 ships per year, including three submarines.  I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. And on this, there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin. And I will call on our NATO allies to keep the greatest military alliance in history strong by honoring their commitment to each devote 2 percent of their GDP to security spending. Today, only 3 of the 28 NATO nations meet this benchmark. I will make further reforms to our foreign assistance to create incentives for good governance, free enterprise, and greater trade, in the Middle East and beyond. I will organize all assistance efforts in the greater Middle East under one official with responsibility and accountability to prioritize efforts and produce results.  I will rally our friends and allies to match our generosity with theirs.  And I will make it clear to the recipients of our aid that, in return for our material support, they must meet the responsibilities of every decent modern government—to respect the rights of all of their citizens, including women and minorities... to ensure space for civil society, a free media, political parties, and an independent judiciary... and to abide by their international commitments to protect our diplomats and our property. I will champion free trade and restore it as a critical element of our strategy, both in the Middle East and across the world.  The President has not signed one new free trade agreement in the past four years.  I will reverse that failure.  I will work with nations around the world that are committed to the principles of free enterprise, expanding existing relationships and establishing new ones. I will support friends across the Middle East who share our values, but need help defending them and their sovereignty against our common enemies. In Libya, I will support the Libyan people's efforts to forge a lasting government that represents all of them, and I will vigorously pursue the terrorists who attacked our consulate in Benghazi and killed Americans.   In Egypt, I will use our influence—including clear conditions on our aid—to urge the new government to represent all Egyptians, to build democratic institutions, and to maintain its peace treaty with Israel. And we must persuade our friends and allies to place similar stipulations on their aid. In Syria, I will work with our partners to identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad's tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets. Iran is sending arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them.  We should be working no less vigorously with our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran—rather than sitting on the sidelines.  It is essential that we develop influence with those forces in Syria that will one day lead a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East.  And in Afghanistan, I will pursue a real and successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014.  President Obama would have you believe that anyone who disagrees with his decisions in Afghanistan is arguing for endless war. But the route to more war — and to potential attacks here at home — is a politically timed retreat that abandons the Afghan people to the same extremists who ravaged their country and used it to launch the attacks of 9/11.  I will evaluate conditions on the ground and weigh the best advice of our military commanders. And I will affirm that my duty is not to my political prospects, but to the security of the nation. Finally, I will recommit America to the goal of a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel.  On this vital issue, the President has failed, and what should be a negotiation process has devolved into a series of heated disputes at the United Nations. In this old conflict, as in every challenge we face in the Middle East, only a new President will bring the chance to begin anew. There is a longing for American leadership in the Middle East—and it is not unique to that region.  It is broadly felt by America's friends and allies in other parts of the world as well— in Europe, where Putin's Russia casts a long shadow over young democracies, and where our oldest allies have been told we are ""pivoting"" away from them ... in Asia and across the Pacific, where China's recent assertiveness is sending chills through the region ... and here in our own hemisphere, where our neighbors in Latin America want to resist the failed ideology of Hugo Chavez and the Castro brothers and deepen ties with the United States on trade, energy, and security.  But in all of these places, just as in the Middle East, the question is asked:  ""Where does America stand?"" I know many Americans are asking a different question: ""Why us?""  I know many Americans are asking whether our country today—with our ailing economy, and our massive debt, and after 11 years at war—is still capable of leading.  I believe that if America does not lead, others will—others who do not share our interests and our values—and the world will grow darker, for our friends and for us.  America's security and the cause of freedom cannot afford four more years like the last four years.  I am running for President because I believe the leader of the free world has a duty, to our citizens, and to our friends everywhere, to use America's great influence—wisely, with solemnity and without false pride, but also firmly and actively—to shape events in ways that secure our interests, further our values, prevent conflict, and make the world better—not perfect, but better.  Our friends and allies across the globe do not want less American leadership.  They want more—more of our moral support, more of our security cooperation, more of our trade, and more of our assistance in building free societies and thriving economies.  So many people across the world still look to America as the best hope of humankind.  So many people still have faith in America.  We must show them that we still have faith in ourselves—that we have the will and the wisdom to revive our stagnant economy, to roll back our unsustainable debt, to reform our government, to reverse the catastrophic cuts now threatening our national defense, to renew the sources of our great power, and to lead the course of human events. Sir Winston Churchill once said of George Marshall:  ""He ... always fought victoriously against defeatism, discouragement, and disillusion.""  That is the role our friends want America to play again.  And it is the role we must play.  The 21st century can and must be an American century. It began with terror, war, and economic calamity. It is our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom, peace, and prosperity.  The torch America carries is one of decency and hope. It is not America's torch alone. But it is America's duty — and honor — to hold it high enough that all the world can see its light. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.  "
Mitt Romney,10/18/2012,Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York City,Northeast,"Mitt Romney, Remarks at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York City Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/315837","Thank you.   Thank you.   Thank you. Thank you so much. Your Eminence Cardinal Dolan, Mr. president, Governor Cuomo, Mayor Bloomberg, Senator Schumer, Al and Ann Smith, thank you for your invitation. Thank you for your extraordinary warm welcome. Ann and I appreciate your friendship very, very much. Thank you.   Now, AL, you are right. A campaign can require a lot of wardrobe changes. We — blue jeans in the morning perhaps, a suit for a lunch fundraise, sport coat for dinner. But it's nice to finally relax and to wear what Ann and I wear around the house. [laughter and applause] I'm glad to be able to join in this venerable tradition. Of course, I'm pleased that the president's here. We were chatting pleasantly this evening as if Tuesday night never happened. [laughter] And I credit that of course to the cardinal. It's taken New York's highest spiritual authority to get us back on our best behavior. I was actually hoping the president would bring Joe Biden along this evening because he'll laugh at anything. [laughter and applause] Of course, this isn't a night for serious politics and it was especially nice to see President Obama and Cardinal Dolan sharing the dais despite their differences. I'm sure the cardinal has no hard feelings and we might get an indication of that during dinner to see if the president's wine turns into water. Or for that matter, whether my water turns into wine. [laughter] I'm pleased to once again have the chance to see Governor Cuomo who's already being talked about for higher office — a very impressive fellow. But he may be getting a little ahead of himself. I mean, let me get this straight. The man has put in one term as a governor, he has a father who happened to be a governor and he thinks that's enough to run for president. [laughter and applause] Of course, we're down to the final months of the president's term. As presidents — [laughter]. As President Obama surveys the Waldorf banquet room, with everyone in white tie and finery, you have to wonder what he's thinking. So little time, so much to redistribute. [laughter and applause] And don't be surprised if the president mentions this evening the monthly jobs report where there was a slight improvement in the numbers. He knows how to seize the moment, this president, and already has a compelling new campaign slogan: you're better off now than you were four weeks ago. [laughter] You know, with or without all the dignitaries that are here, the Al Smith Dinner surely lives up to its billing. Usually when I get invited to gatherings like this, it's just to be the designated driver. [laughter and applause] Your kind hospitality here tonight gives me a chance to convey my deep and long held respect for the Catholic Church. I have special admiration for the Apostle St. Peter, to whom it is said: upon this rock I will build my church. The story's all the more inspiring when you consider that he had so many skeptics and scoffers at the time who were heard to say: if you've got a church, you didn't build that. [laughter] Of course, only 19 days to go until the finish line, campaign full of surprises. The debates are very exciting. Just the other night we had a very fun debate. Candy Crowley was there and was happy to welcome us. But people seem to be very curious as to how we prepare for the debates. Let me tell you what I do. First, refrain from alcohol for 65 years before the debate. [laughter] Second, find the biggest available straw man and then just mercilessly attack it. Big Bird didn't even see it coming. [laughter] And by the way, in the spirit of Sesame Street, the president's remarks tonight are brought to you by the letter O and the number 16 trillion. [laughter] Campaigns can be grueling, exhausting. President Obama and I are each very lucky to have one person who's always in our corner, someone who we can lean on and someone who's a comforting presence without whom we wouldn't be able to go another day. I have my beautiful Ann. He has Bill Clinton. [laughter] We got a big dose of the Biden charm last week, I'll tell you that, in his debate with Paul Ryan. I'm not sure that all that carrying on had quite the effect that Joe intended because afterwards I heard from the Federal Election Commission. From now on, whenever he appears on TV, there's a recording immediately afterwards that says: I'm Mitt Romney and I approved this message. [laughter] Of course, rules of fairness have to be enforced because what other safeguard do we have besides the press, and — (laughter, applause). Now, I'd never suggest that the press is biased. I recognize they have their job to do and I have my job to do. My job is to lay out a positive vision for the future of the country. And their job is to make sure no one else finds out about it. [laughter and applause] Let's just say that some in the media have a certain way of looking at things. When suddenly I pulled ahead in some of the major polls, what was the headline? Polls show Obama leading from behind. [laughter] And I've already seen early reports from tonight's dinner. Headline: Obama embraced by Catholics. Romney dines with rich people. [laughter and applause] Of course, the president has put his own stamp on relations with the church. There've been some awkward moments, like when the president pulled Pope Benedict aside to share some advice on how to deal with his critics. He said, look, Holy Father, whatever the problem is, just blame it on Pope John Paul II. [laughter] Of course, the president has found a way to take the sting out of the ""Obamacare"" mandates for the church. From now on, they're going to be in Latin. [laughter] We have very fundamental and sound principles that guide both the president and me. He and I of course feel the pressures and tensions of a close contest. It'd be easy to let a healthy competition give way to the personal and the petty. But fortunately, we don't carry the burden of disliking one another. Our president has had some very fine and gracious moments. Don't tell him when I said so but our 44th president has many gifts and a beautiful family that would make any man proud. You can oppose —  . In our country, you can oppose someone in politics and make a confident case against their policies without any ill will and that's how it is for me. There's more to life than politics. At the Al Smith Foundation and the Archdiocese of New York, you show this in the work you do, in causes that run deeper than allegiance to party or to any contest of the moment. No matter which way the political winds are blowing, what work goes on day in and day out by this organization and you, you answer with calm and with wiling hearts, in service to the poor, in care for the sick, in defense of the rights of conscience and in solidarity with the innocent child waiting to be born. You strive to bring God's love into every life.   I don't presume to have all your support and on a night like this I'm certainly not going to ask for it. But you can be certain that in the great causes of compassion that you come together to embrace that I stand proudly with you as an ally and friend. God bless you all and God bless the United States of America. Thank you.    "
Mitt Romney,10/26/2012,"Economy in Ames, Iowa",Midwest,"Mitt Romney, Remarks on the Economy in Ames, Iowa Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/300877","Thank you all. It's great to be back in Iowa. And don't think that this is the last time you are going to see Paul Ryan and me, because you Iowans may well be the ones who decide what kind of America we will have, what kind of life our families will have. The choice you make this November will shape great things, historic things, and those things will determine the most intimate and important aspects of every American life and every American family. This is an election about America, and it is an election about the American family. All elections matter. This one matters a great deal. Over the years of our nation's history, choices our fellow citizens have made have changed the country's course--they were turning points of defining consequence. We are at a turning point today. Our national debt and liabilities threaten to crush our future, our economy struggles under the weight of government and fails to create essential growth and employment. At the same time, emerging powers seek to shape the world in their image--China with its model of authoritarianism and, in a very different way, Jihadists with Sharia, repression, and terror for the world. This is an election of consequence. Our campaign is about big things, because we happen to believe that America faces big challenges. We recognize this is a year with a big choice, and the American people want to see big changes. And together we can bring real change to this country. Four years ago, candidate Obama spoke to the scale of the times. Today, he shrinks from it, trying instead to distract our attention from the biggest issues to the smallest--from characters on Sesame Street and silly word games to misdirected personal attacks he knows are false. The President's campaign falls far short of the magnitude of the times. And the presidency of the last four years has fallen far short of the promises of his last campaign. Four years ago, America voted for a post-partisan president, but they have seen the most political of presidents, and a Washington in gridlock because of it. President Obama promised to bring us together, but at every turn, he has sought to divide and demonize. He promised to cut the deficit in half, but he doubled it. And his budget? It failed to win a single vote, Republican or Democrat, in either the House or the Senate. He said he would reform Medicare and Social Security and save them from pending insolvency, but he shrunk from proposing any solution at all. And then, where are the jobs? Where are the 9 million more jobs that President Obama promised his stimulus would have created by now? They are in China, Mexico, and Canada and in countries that have made themselves more attractive for entrepreneurs and business and investment, even as President Obama's policies have made it less attractive for them here. And so today, his campaign tries to deflect and detract, to minimize the failures, and to make this election about small shiny objects. But this election matters more than that. It matters to your family. It matters to the senior who needs to get an appointment with a medical specialist but is told by one receptionist after another that the doctor isn't taking any new Medicare patients, because Medicare has been slashed to pay for Obamacare. It matters to the man from Waukesha, Wisconsin I spoke with several days ago. In what were supposed to be his best work years, he used to have a job at $25 an hour with benefits and now has one at $8 an hour, without benefits. It matters to the college student, graduating this spring, with 10 to 20 thousand dollars in student debt, who now learns that she also will be paying for 50 thousand dollars in government debt, a burden that will put the American Dream beyond her reach. It matters for the child in a failing school, unable to go to the school of his parent's choosing, because the teacher's union that funds the President's campaign opposes school choice. The President's campaign has a slogan: it is ""forward."" But to the 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job, these last four years feel a lot more like ""backward."" We cannot afford four more years like the last four years. This election is about big things--like the education of our children, the value of our homes, the take home pay from our jobs, the price of the gasoline we buy, and the choices we have in our healthcare. It is also about the big things that determine these things--like the growth of the economy, the strength of our military, our dependence on foreign oil, and America's leadership in the world. President Obama frequently reminds us that he inherited a troubled economy. But a troubled economy is not all that President Obama inherited. He inherited the greatest nation in the history of the earth. He inherited the most productive and innovative nation in history. He inherited the largest economy in the world. And he inherited a people who have always risen to the occasion, regardless of the challenges they faced, so long as we have been led by men and women who have brought us together, called on our patriotism, and guided the nation with vision and conviction. Despite all that he inherited, President Obama did not repair our economy, he did not save Medicare and Social Security, he did not tame the spending and borrowing, he did not reach across the aisle to bring us together. Nor did he stand up to China's trade practices, or deliver on his promise to re-make our relations with the Muslim world, where anti-American extremism is on the rise. What he inherited wasn't the only problem; what he did with what he inherited made the problem worse. In just four short years, he borrowed nearly $6 trillion, adding almost as much debt held by the public as all prior American presidents in history. He forced through Obamacare, frightening small business from hiring new employees and adding thousands of dollars to every family's healthcare bill. He launched an onslaught of new regulations, often to the delight of the biggest banks and corporations, but to the detriment of the small, growing businesses that create two-thirds of our jobs. New business starts are at a 30-year low because entrepreneurs and investors are sitting on the sidelines, weary from the President's staggering new regulations and proposed massive tax increases. Many families can't get mortgages and many entrepreneurs can't get loans because of Dodd-Frank regulations that make it harder for banks to lend. The president invested taxpayer money--your money--in green companies, now failed, that met his fancy, and sometimes were owned by his largest campaign contributors. He spent billions of taxpayer dollars on investments like Solyndra, Tesla, Fisker, and Ener1, which only added to our mounting federal debt. Energy prices are up in part because energy production on federal lands is down. He rejected the Keystone Pipeline from Canada, and cut in half drilling permits and leases, even as gasoline prices soared to new highs. No, the problem with the Obama economy is not what he inherited; it is with the misguided policies that slowed the recovery, and caused millions of Americans to endure lengthy unemployment and poverty. That is why 15 million more of our fellow citizens are on food stamps than when President Obama was sworn into office. That is why 3 million more women are now living in poverty. That is why nearly 1 in 6 Americans today is poor. That is why the economy is stagnant. Today, we received the latest round of discouraging economic news: Last quarter, our economy grew at just 2%. After the stimulus was passed, the White House promised the economy would now be growing at 4.3%, over twice as fast. Slow economic growth means slow job growth and declining take home pay. This is what four years of President Obama's policies have produced. Americans are ready for change--for growth, for jobs, for more take home pay. We have had four presidential and vice-presidential debates. And there is nothing in what the President proposed or defended that has any prospect of meeting the challenges of the times. Raising taxes will not grow jobs or ignite the economy--in fact, his tax plan has been calculated to destroy 700,000 jobs. A new stimulus, three years after the recession officially ended, may spare government, but it will not stimulate the private sector any better than did the stimulus of four years ago. And cutting one trillion dollars from the military will kill jobs and devastate our national defense. This is not the time to double down on the trickle-down government policies that have failed us; it is time for new bold changes that measure up to the moment, that can bring America's families the certainty that the future will be better than the past. If Paul Ryan and I are elected as your president and vice president, we will endeavor with all our hearts and energy to restore America. Instead of more spending, more borrowing from China and higher taxes from Washington, we'll renew our faith in the power of free people pursuing their dreams. We'll start with our plan for a stronger middle class, which has five elements: One, we will act to put America on track to a balanced budget by eliminating unnecessary programs, by sending programs back to states where they can be managed with less abuse and less cost, and by shrinking the bureaucracy of Washington. Two, we'll produce more of the energy we need to heat our homes, fill our cars, and make our economy grow. We will stop the Obama war on coal, the disdain for oil, and the effort to crimp natural gas by federal regulation of the very technology that produces it. We will support nuclear and renewables, but phase out subsidies once an industry is on its feet. And rather than investing in new electric auto and solar companies, we will invest in energy science and research to make discoveries that can actually change our energy world. And by 2020, we will achieve North American energy independence. Three, we will make trade work for America. We'll open more markets to American agriculture, products, and services. And we will finally hold accountable any nation that doesn't play by the rules. I will stand up for the rights and interests of American workers and employers. Four, we will grow jobs by making America the best possible place for job creators, for entrepreneurs, for small business, for innovators, for manufacturers. This we will do by updating and reshaping regulations to encourage growth, by lowering tax rates while lowering deductions and closing loopholes, and by making it clear from day one that unlike the current administration, we actually like business and the jobs business creates. Finally, as we create more opportunity, we also will make sure that our citizens have the skills to succeed. Training programs will be shaped by the states where people live, and schools will put the interests of our kids, their parents, and their teachers above the interests of the teachers' unions. If we do those five things, our economy will come roaring back. We will create 12 million new jobs in just four years, raise take-home pay, and get the American economy growing at four percent a year—more than double this year's rate. After all the false promises of recovery and all the waiting, we will finally see help for America's middle class. Paul and I won't stop there. When we take office, we will take responsibility to solve the big problems that everyone agrees can't wait any longer. We will save and secure Medicare and Social Security, both for current and near retirees, and for the generation to come. We will restore the $716 billion President Obama has taken from Medicare to pay for his vaunted Obamacare. We will reform healthcare to tame the growth in its cost, to provide for those with pre-existing conditions, and to assure that every American has access to healthcare. We will replace government choice with consumer choice, bringing the dynamics of the marketplace to a sector of our lives that has long been dominated by government. These things among others we can only do if we work tirelessly to bridge the divide between the political parties. We will meet with Democrat and Republican leadership regularly, we will look for common ground and shared principles, and we will put the interests of the American people above the interests of the politicians. I know something about leading because I've led before. In business, at the Olympics, and in Massachusetts, I've brought people together to achieve real change. I was elected as a Republican governor in a state with a legislature that was 85% Democrat. We were looking at a multi-billion dollar budget gap. But instead of fighting with one another, we came together to solve our problems. We actually cut spending--reduced it. We lowered taxes 19 times. We defended school choice. And we worked to make our state business friendly. Our state moved up 20 places in job growth. Our schools were ranked number one in the nation. And we turned a $3 billion budget deficit into a $2 billion rainy day fund. I know it because I have seen it: Good Democrats can come together with good Republicans to solve big problems. What we need is leadership. America is ready for that kind of leadership. Paul Ryan and I will provide it. Our plan for a stronger middle class will create jobs, stop the decline in take home pay, and put America back on the path of prosperity and opportunity. And this will enable us to fulfill our responsibility as the leader of the free world, to promote the principles of peace. We will help the Muslim world combat the spread of extremism; we will dissuade Iran from building a nuclear bomb; we will build enduring relationships throughout Latin America; and we will partner with China and other great nations to build a more stable and peaceful world. We face big challenges. But we also have big opportunities. New doors are open for us to sell our ideas and our products to the entire world. New technologies offer the promise of unbounded information and limitless innovation. New ideas are changing lives and hearts in diverse nations and among diverse peoples. If we seize the moment and rise to the occasion, the century ahead will be an American Century. Our children will graduate into jobs that are waiting for them. Our seniors will be confident that their retirement is secure. Our men and women will have good jobs and good pay and good benefits. And we will have every confidence that our lives are safe, and that our livelihoods are secure. What this requires is change, change from the course of the last four years. It requires that we put aside the small and the petty, and demand the scale of change we deserve: we need real change, big change. Our campaign is about that kind of change--confronting the problems that politicians have avoided for over a decade, revitalizing our competitive economy, modernizing our education, restoring our founding principles. This is the kind of change that promises a better future, one shaped by men and women pursuing their dreams in their own unique ways. This election is a choice between the status quo -- going forward with the same policies of the last four years -- or instead, choosing real change, change that offers promise, promise that the future will be better than the past. If you are ready for that kind of change, if you want this to be a turning point in America's course, join Paul Ryan and me, get your family and friends to join us, and vote now for the kind of leadership that these times demand. God bless you. And God bless America.  "
Mitt Romney,11/2/2012,"West Allis, Wisconsin",Midwest,"Mitt Romney, Remarks in West Allis, Wisconsin: ""Real Change From Day One"" Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/303673","Thank you. It's good to be in the home state of the next Vice President of the United States. Next to Ann Romney, Paul Ryan is the best choice I ever made. Tonight, we enter the final weekend of the campaign. At Obama rallies, they are saying ""Four More Years."" We are shouting ""Four More Days."" We are so very grateful to you and to people across the country, for all that you have given of yourselves to this campaign. This is not just about Paul and me--it is about America, and the future we will leave to our children. We thank you, and we ask you to stay at it all the way — all the way to victory on Tuesday night. The closing hours of a campaign have a dynamic of their own. Many voters have known for some time who they will vote for. Others are just now putting aside the demands of daily life and considering how their vote will affect their life, the lives of their children, and the course of the country we love. We ask you to look beyond the speeches and the attacks and the ads. Look to the record, the accomplishments and failures, and the judgment. Words are cheap. A record is real and earned with effort. Change cannot be measured in speeches; it is measured in achievements. Four years ago, candidate Obama promised to do so very much, but he has fallen so very short. He promised to be a ""post-partisan president"" but he became the most partisan-- blaming, attacking, dividing. He was going to focus on creating jobs. Instead, he focused on Obamacare, which killed jobs. He said he was going to cut the federal deficit by half; then he doubled it. He said that the unemployment rate would now be 5.2%; today we learned that it is 7.9%--it is 9 million jobs short of what he promised. Unemployment is higher today than when Barack Obama took office. He promised that he would propose a plan to save Social Security and Medicare from insolvency. He did not; rather, he raided $716 billion from Medicare for his vaunted Obamacare. He would lower health premiums by $2,500. Now they are higher by $3,000. And gasoline? The American family pays $2,000 a year more for gasoline today than when he was elected. He said he would work across the aisle on the most important issues. He has not met on the economy, or on the budget, or on jobs, with either the Republican leader of the House or the Senate since July. Instead of bridging the divide, he has made it wider. How is it that he has fallen so short of what he promised? In part, it is because he has never led, never worked across the aisle, never truly understood how jobs are created in the economy. And today, he makes new promises, promises he will be unable to keep, because he admits that he will stay on the same path. The same course we have been on will not lead to a better destination. The same path means $20 trillion in debt, crippling unemployment, stagnant take-home pay, depressed home values, and a devastated military. And unless we change course, we may be looking at another recession. The question of this election comes down to this: do you want more of the same or do you want real change? President Obama promised change, but he could not deliver it. I promise change, and I have a record of achieving it. I built a business, and turned around another. I helped put an Olympics back on track. And with a Democratic legislature, I helped turn my state from deficit to surplus, from job losses to job growth, and from higher taxes to higher take-home pay. This is why I am running for president. I know how to change the course the nation is on, how to get us to a balanced budget and how to build jobs and rising take-home pay. Accomplishing real change is not something I just talk about--it is something I have done. And it is what will do when I am President of the United States. If you believe we can do better, if you believe America should be on a better course, if you are tired of being tired, then I ask you to vote for real change. Paul Ryan and I will bring real change to America, from Day One. When I am elected, the economy and American jobs will still be stagnant. I won't waste any time complaining about my predecessor. I won't spend my effort trying to pass partisan legislation unrelated to economic growth. From Day One, I will go to work to help Americans get back to work. People across the country are responding to our five-part plan to create jobs. Part one is about taking full advantage of our energy resources. On Day One, I will act to increase the number of leases and permits to drill on federal lands. I will act to speed the approval of the Keystone pipeline from Canada. I will re-visit coal regulations that were designed by the administration to strangle the industry. On Day One, we will be closer to energy independence. Second, I will move to boost trade, especially with Latin America. I will ask Congress for Trade Promotion Authority, a power every president has used or requested since it was first created in 1974, with the exception of President Obama. And I will finally designate China as a currency manipulator. It is time for trade that works for America. Third, I will send to Congress the Retraining Reform Act, to make sure that every worker who feels left behind in this economy can get the skills and the chance for a good-paying job. Fourth, I will move to tackle out-of-control spending. I will send Congress the first of several fundamental reforms called the Down Payment on Fiscal Sanity Act, to immediately cut--not just slow the rate of growth-- but cut non-security discretionary spending by 5%. I'm not just going to take office on January 20th — I'm going to take responsibility for the office as well. And fifth, I will act to boost small business, and all business. I will issue executive orders aimed straight at the problems that are holding this economy back. The first will grant state waivers from Obamacare, to begin its repeal. The second will launch a sweeping review of all Obama-era regulations with an eye to eliminating or repairing those that are killing jobs and small businesses. And every entrepreneur, every small-business person, every job creator will know that for the first time in four years, the government of the United States likes business and loves the jobs and higher wages business brings to our fellow Americans. We have almost forgotten what a real recovery looks like — what Americans can achieve when we limit government instead of limiting the dreams of our fellow Americans. You can choose your future. You know what you need to know. You can stay on the path of the last four years, or you can choose real change. You know that if the President is re-elected, he will still be unable to work with the people in Congress. He has ignored them, attacked them, blamed them. The debt ceiling will come up again, and shutdown and default will be threatened, chilling the economy. The President was right when he said he can't change Washington from the inside. In this case, you can take him at his word. When I am elected, I will work with Republicans and Democrats in Congress. I will meet regularly with their leaders. I will endeavor to find those good men and women on both sides of the aisle who care more about the country than about the politics. Together, we will put the nation on track to a balanced budget, to reform our tax code, and to finally reaffirm our commitment to financial responsibility. You know that if the President is re-elected, he will continue his war on coal and oil and natural gas. He will send billions more dollars to his favorite solar and wind companies. And all of this will guarantee higher energy prices at the pump and fewer jobs. Today, gas costs twice what it did when President Obama was elected. When I am elected, we will change course on energy. I know just how much energy means to middle-class families. We can help hold down prices at the pump and grow new energy jobs and manufacturing jobs. You know that if the President is re-elected, he will continue to promote government and demote business. He chose his own jobs council, made up of business leaders. And he hasn't met with them in 9 months. 9 months. I like business, I don't see it as a necessary evil. I see it as a means for people to fulfill their dreams. Yesterday, I met Rhoda Elliott. She has been running her family restaurants for years, a business that has been in her family for 82 years. At its high point, she employed 200 people. She just closed it down telling me that regulations, taxes and the effects of the Obama economy put her out of business. She teared up--this wasn't about money, this was about a future for her family and for her family of employees. I want to help the hundreds of thousands of dreamers like Rhoda. And I will. You know that if the President is re-elected, he will say every good thing he can about education, but in the final analysis, he will do what his largest campaign supporters--the public-sector unions--insist upon. And your kids will have the same schools with the same results. When I am president, I will be a voice of the children and their parents. There is no union for the PTA. I will give parents the information they need to know if their school is failing, and the choice they need to pick the school where their child can succeed. I have watched over these last few months as our campaign has gathered the strength of a movement. It's not just the size of the crowds, it's the depth of our shared conviction ... the readiness for new possibilities ... the sense that the challenges are clear and our work will soon begin. It has made me strive even more to be worthy of the office ... to campaign as I would govern ... to speak for the aspirations of all Americans. I learned as Governor of Massachusetts that the best achievements are shared achievements. I learned that respect and good will go a long way, and are usually returned in kind. That is how I will conduct myself as president. I will reach out to both sides of the aisle. I will bring people together, doing big things for the common good. I won't just represent one party, I'll represent one nation. I'll try to show the best of America, at a time when only our best will do. Throughout this campaign, using every argument he can think of, President Obama has tried to convince you that, yes, these last four years have been a success. He's so sure of this that he's got one big plan for the next four years: Let's take all those ideas from the first term — the stimulus, the borrowing, Obamacare, and the rest — and go back and do them all over again. But it could be boiled down to four words: More of the same. I do not believe this is a moment when our big dreams will be satisfied with a small agenda. I will lead America to a better place, where confidence in the future is assured, not questioned. This is not a time to settle! We are four days away from a fresh start. Four days away from the first day of a new beginning. My conviction that better days are ahead is not based on promises and hollow rhetoric but solid plans and proven results. And an unshakeable faith in the American spirit. If there is anyone worried the last four years are the best we can do, if there is anyone who fears that the American dream is fading away, if there is anyone who wonders whether better jobs and better paychecks are things of the past, I have a clear and unequivocal message: with the right leadership, America will come roaring back. We are Americans. We can do anything. The only thing that stands between us and some of the best years we have known is lack of leadership. And that's why we have elections. This Tuesday is a moment to look into the future and imagine what we can do ... to put the past four years behind us and start building a new future. You saw the differences when President Obama and I were side-by-side in our debates. He says it has to be this way. I say it can't stay this way. He's offering excuses, I've got a plan. He's hoping we'll settle. I can't wait for us to get started. Americans don't settle. We build, we aspire, we listen to that voice inside that says, ""We can do better."" A better job; a better life for our kids; a bigger, better country. That better life is out there, waiting for us. Our destiny is in your hands. Four more days. Four more days and we can get to work rebuilding our country, restoring our confidence and renewing our conviction. Confidence that we are on a solid path to steady improvement. Confidence that college grads four years from now will find better jobs. Confidence that the single moms working two jobs will have a shot at a better job. On November 6th, we come together for a better future. And on November 7th, we'll get to work. We'll reach across the street to that neighbor with the other yard sign and we'll reach across the aisle in Washington to people of good faith in the other party. This is much more than our moment. It is America's moment of renewal and purpose and optimism. We have journeyed far and wide in this great campaign for America's future. And now we are almost home. One final push will get us there. We have known many long days and short nights and now we are close. The door to a brighter future is there, open, waiting for us. I need your vote, I need your help. Walk with me, walk together. Let us start anew. God bless each of you and God bless the United States of America.  "
